Carmen is eighteen. She has
long, dark hair. Her eyes are
blue. She's beautiful.

Mr Blane gives Len a photo. He says,

at two o'clock on Tuesday. Frank has
the $100 000. He's going with you.
Give the money to The Young Ones.
Bring Carmen home. I'll pay you $1000.'

Len says, 'I don't like you, Blane.

Carmen is in trouble. She needs help.
I'll help her.'

It's 2 pm on Tuesday. Frank and Len
are at the bus station. Frank has
$100000 in a bag.

is with her. The young man is holding
Carmen's arm.
