My story starts in late July. It was July 21st, I think. It was the first day of our holiday, a hot July day. I stood in the sun and looked at the sea. It was eleven o'clock in the morning. I was on the boat at Portsmouth with my brother
and father and my sister, Louise. Sea birds played near our big boat and the small boats near us on the sea.
I started to look at the people with us on our boat. They all watched the sea birds and talked and laughed. They were all happy on the first day of their holiday too. And suddenly there he was, this tall, quiet boy in a blue and white shirt: he was really good looking. I'll always remember the first time I saw him.
He didn't see me then. He was with some friends. One of the boys was his brother, I think: they had the same blue eyes, the same mouth and nose, nearly the same hair. His brother and one of the boys with him tried to catch the sea birds and he smiled at them. Then they came and stood near us, and they talked about the small boats on the sea. I watched him over Louise's head all the time!
His brother and his friend made a lot of noise, but he was quiet and didn't talk a lot. Then suddenly he looked at me and his eyes stayed on me, and he smiled his lovely smile with his shy blue eyes.
The people near me on the boat, the sun, the sea and the birds, the noise of all his friends, time - it all stopped. At that moment there was only him and me, me and him. Him and his smile for me. Only the two of us.
Slowly, very slowly, the boat started to move away, across the water to Spain. It takes a day and a night on the boat from Portsmouth to Santander, in Spain. A day and a night together on the same boat, with him.
