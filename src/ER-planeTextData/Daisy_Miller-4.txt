The little town of Vevey, in Switzerland, stands beside Lake Geneva. Many travelers come to visit the beautiful blue lake, and so its shore 13 is crowded with 14 hotels. There are many different kinds of hotel around the lake. There are new, grand hotels which are painted white. And there are also small pensions—simple, old hotels with just a few rooms. The grand hotels have lots of rooms with big windows, and flags fly on their roofs. The pensions are smaller, with fewer rooms. However, one of the hotels in Vevey is very different from the others because it is old but also very comfortable. This hotel is named the Trois Couronnes—the ThreeCrowns 15.The hotel is very popular with Americans. Many American travelers visit Vevey in summer and a lot of them stay at the Trois Couronnes. At this time, the town is full of fashionable 16 young girls in beautiful dresses. At night in the hotel, you can hear the sounds of excited voices and lively music. The voices have American accents17and an orchestra plays dance music. You can almost believe that you are in America! However, the Trois Couronnes is a European hotel. It has neatlsy-dressed18German waiters. And in the garden you might meet a Russian princess, or the son of a Polish gentleman.
