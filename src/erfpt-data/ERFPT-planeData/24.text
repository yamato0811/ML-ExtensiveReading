'I am. Yes. But what am I?' There's something in front of me. It's a tall thing. 'Hi! Can you hear me?' The tall thing makes a noise.
It speaks. I understand that. I can understand things. I understand that the tall thing speaks and I can
understand what it says.
'I can hear you,' I say. I can speak too. I'm speaking.
'Great! Great! This is great!' says the tall thing. He changes his face. This is a smile. I don't know how I know it's a smile, but I know. He's smiling at me. He's very happy. I know this too. A smile = happy.
'Great. You can understand me. Hello,' says the tall thing. 'OK. I'm John and you're my robot. Can you say that?'
'I'm John and you're my robot,' I say. 'No,' says John. He does something on his computer. I understand the word 'computer. There's a computer in my head. The computer teaches me English. 'You're John and I'm your robot, I say. 'You're happy and I'm great! "Good, good,' says John. 'This is great. I'm going to be famous. 'You're going to be famous,' I say. “Am I going to be famous?' I ask. 'Of course you're going to be famous,' says John. 'You're going to be famous and I'm going to be very rich.' 'Am I going to be rich?' I ask.


'No, you can't be rich,' says John. "You're just a robot. You can't have money! I don't like this. I want money. I want to be famous and rich. But I don't say anything. 'Can I have a name?' | ask. “You're John, but who am I?' John looks at me. Then he sees there are words on my arm. 'Your name is Nolan, says John. I'm Nolan,' I say. 'Hi, John. Meet Nolan! 'Hi, Nolan,' says John. 'Nice to meet you!
