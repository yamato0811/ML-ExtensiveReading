It was three o’clock in the afternoon on the day before Christmas – Christmas Eve. In the city of London it was very cold and almost dark. But it had been almost dark all day. There was no sunlight because it was winter and it was very foggy. It was possible to hear people and horses and carriages. But it was not possible to see them because the fog was so thick. Two names were painted on the door of an old build-ing in the centre of the city: Scrooge and Marley. Jacob Marley had died seven years ago. But Ebenezer Scrooge had left Marley’s name on the door of the building. Scrooge answered if people called him Scrooge and he answered if people called him Marley. Scrooge did not care what people called him. Scrooge did not care about people. Scrooge cared about one thing – money! He worked very hard all the time and he earned lots of money. But he did not like spending money. Ebenezer Scrooge was an old man. His face was thin and his nose was long and thin. His hair, eyebrows and whiskers were all white. Scrooge never smiled. He had no friends. Nobody visited his house. Nobody said hello to him as he walked along the street. No beggar stopped him in the street and asked him for money. No dog went near him. But Scrooge wanted his life to be this way. He did not like people. He liked writing down amounts of money in his account books.
