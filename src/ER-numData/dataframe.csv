0,13,C2,Miranda,"The children and their father remember Miranda of course and they talk about her sometimes.
Mirandas sister often visits us and she always tells the children a story about their mother. Nick remembers
Miranda I know he does. And in the hospital Grandma remembers too. They all remember Miranda.
I never met Miranda but every day I look at her photograph next to the telephone in the kitchen the picture of her with her children. Every day I look at her beautiful dark eyes and her long dark hair.
I first saw Mirandas photograph two years ago. It was a cold October day and I left London for my new job with a family in Norfolk. I drove north past Norwich and it began to rain. It was dark and there was a strong wind so I drove slowly and carefully. I wanted to see the Harvey children before they went to bed. But because of the weather it was eight oclock before I arrived in Cromer. I drove through the town along the sea road.
Suddenly I stopped. There was a tree across the road. I got out of my car. It was a big tree and I couldnt move it. Just then a car drove up behind me and a man got out.
Whats the matter Oh a tree across the road. He was a tall man about thirty years old. Where are you going he asked. Not far I said. Its a house along this road near the sea. Its called Beach House.
Oh I know Beach House the man said. Its the last house along this road. But you cant drive there tonight with this tree across the road. He stopped for a minute.

Im Nick Watson and I live at the farm along the road. We can go back to my house and then walk across the fields to Beach House. Are you visiting for the weekend
No no. Im going to work in the house and look after Mr Harveys children. Their mother died two years ago
and their grandmother has arthritis in her legs and cant walk much now. So Im going to look after the children and the house I told him. I met old Mrs Harvey in London six weeks ago and she gave me the job. Do you know the Harveys
The man laughed. His laugh was warm and friendly. Oh yes I know them he said.
We drove back down the road and into the farm. Then we walked across the fields. It was dark and windy and cold. After ten minutes we arrived at a big white house. The lights were on downstairs and the house looked friendly. I had no home because my mother and father died a long time ago and I had no brothers or sisters. This was my first job and I wanted to be happy in this house.
A man opened the door. He looked tired and there was no smile on his face. Hello Im Cathy Wilson I began. Im very late I know. Its because the weathers so bad

1,14,P1,Girl Meets Boy,"My story starts in late July. It was July 21st I think. It was the first day of our holiday a hot July day. I stood in the sun and looked at the sea. It was eleven oclock in the morning. I was on the boat at Portsmouth with my brother
and father and my sister Louise. Sea birds played near our big boat and the small boats near us on the sea.
I started to look at the people with us on our boat. They all watched the sea birds and talked and laughed. They were all happy on the first day of their holiday too. And suddenly there he was this tall quiet boy in a blue and white shirt he was really good looking. Ill always remember the first time I saw him.
He didnt see me then. He was with some friends. One of the boys was his brother I think they had the same blue eyes the same mouth and nose nearly the same hair. His brother and one of the boys with him tried to catch the sea birds and he smiled at them. Then they came and stood near us and they talked about the small boats on the sea. I watched him over Louises head all the time
His brother and his friend made a lot of noise but he was quiet and didnt talk a lot. Then suddenly he looked at me and his eyes stayed on me and he smiled his lovely smile with his shy blue eyes.
The people near me on the boat the sun the sea and the birds the noise of all his friends time   it all stopped. At that moment there was only him and me me and him. Him and his smile for me. Only the two of us.
Slowly very slowly the boat started to move away across the water to Spain. It takes a day and a night on the boat from Portsmouth to Santander in Spain. A day and a night together on the same boat with him.",348,373,Penguin,6,1.347709,1.078167,1.078167,0.808625,0.0,1.078167,1.617251,1.347709,0.0,1.617251,1.347709,0.808625,0.808625,2.156334,2.156334,1.078167,0.269542,0.269542,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.078167,3.773585,0.539084,0.0,0.0,0.269542,0.0,0.539084,0.269542,0.269542,0.808625,0.269542,0.808625,0.539084,1.078167,0.269542,0.539084,0.539084,0.539084,0.269542,0.539084,1.886792,2.695418,1.078167,1.078167,0.269542,0.808625,1.886792,0.808625,0.539084,0.539084,0.269542,0.0,0.269542,0.269542,2.156334,1.078167,0.539084,0.808625,0.269542,0.0,0.0,1.617251,0.269542,0.269542,0.269542,0.269542,0.0,1.617251,0.269542,0.808625,0.539084,0.0,0.269542,0.539084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.808625,0.0,0.269542,0.808625,0.269542,0.0,0.0,1.078167,0.539084,0.0,0.0,0.808625,0.539084,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.269542,0.0,0.0,0.269542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.808625,0.808625,0.269542,0.269542,0.269542,0.269542,0.269542,0.539084,0.269542,0.539084,0.269542,0.539084,0.269542,1.078167,0.539084,0.269542,0.269542,0.269542,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
2,15,O1,New York,"One dollar and eighty seven cents. That was all. Every day when she went to the shops she spent very little money. She bought the cheapest meat the cheapest vegetables. And when she was tired she still walked round and round the shops to find the cheapest food. She saved every cent possible.
Della counted the money again. There was no mistake. One dollar and eighty seven cents. That was all. And the next day was Christmas.
She couldnt do anything about it. She could only sit down and cry. So she sat there in the poor little room and she cried.
Della lived in this poor little room in New York with her husband James Dillingham Young. They also had a bedroom and a kitchen and a bathroom   all poor little rooms. James Dillingham Young was lucky because he had a job but it was not a good job. These rooms took most of his money.
Della tried to find work but times were bad and there was no work for her. But when Mr James Dillingham Young came home to his rooms Mrs James Dillingham Young called him Jim and put her arms round him. And that was good.
Della stopped crying and she washed her face. She stood by the window and looked out at a grey cat on a grey wall in the grey road. Tomorrow was Christmas Day and she had only one dollar and eighty seven cents to buy Jim a Christmas present. Her Jim. She wanted very much to buy him something really fine something to show


how much she loved him.
Suddenly Della turned round and ran over to look in the glass on the wall. Her eyes were bright.
Now the James Dillingham Youngs had two very special things. One was Jims gold watch. It once belonged to his father and before that to his grandfather. The other special thing was Dellas hair.
Quickly Della let down her beautiful long hair. It fell down her back and it was almost like a coat around her. Then she put her hair up again quickly. For a second or two she stood still and cried a little.
Then she put on her old brown coat and her old brown hat turned and left the room. She went downstairs and out into the road and her eyes were bright.
She walked along by the shops and stopped when she came to a door with Madame Eloise   Hair on it. Inside there was a fat woman. She did not look like an Eloise. Will you buy my hair Della asked.
I buy hair Madame replied. Take your hat off then and show me your hair The beautiful brown hair fell down.
Twenty dollars Madame said and she touched the hair with her hand. Quick Cut it off Give me the money Della said. The next two hours went quickly. Della was happy because she was looking round the shops for Jims present.


At last she found it. It was a gold chain for The Watch. Jim loved his watch but it had no chain. When Della
saw this gold chain she knew immediately that it was right for Jim. She must have it.
The shop took twenty one dollars from her for it and she hurried home with the eighty seven cents. When she arrived there she looked at her very short hair in the glass. What can I do with it she thought.
For the next half an hour she was very busy.
Then she looked again in the glass. Her hair was now in very small curls all over her head. Oh dear. I look like
a school girl she said to herself. Whats Jim going to say when he sees me

3,16,P2,Emil and the Detectives,"Now Emil said his mother get ready your clothes are on your bed. Get dressed and then well have our dinner
Yes Mother
Wait a minute. Have I forgotten anything Your other clothes are in your case. Theres some food for your journey. These flowers are for your aunt. Ill give you the money for your grandmother after dinner. No thats all I
think.
Emil left the room and Mrs Fisher turned to her neighbour Mrs Martin. My sons going to the city for two or
three weeks. At first he didnt want to go. But what can he do here while his schools closed My sisters asked us
again and again to visit her. I cant go because I have so much work. Emils never travelled alone before but hes old enough now. Hell be all right his grandmothers going to meet him at the station
I think hell enjoy the city said Mrs Martin. All boys like it. There are so many things to see. I must go now Mrs Fisher. Goodbye
Emil came back into the room and sat down at the table. His hair was tidy and he was wearing his best jacket. While he ate he watched his mother. I mustnt eat too much he thought. She wont like it when Im going away for the first time.
But his mother was thinking about other things. Dont forget to write to me when you arrive she said. All right


Give my love to your aunt and your grandmother and your cousin Polly. Look after yourself. And be good. I dont want anyone to say that youre not a polite boy
I promise.
After dinner Emils mother went to the sitting room. There was a tin box on one of the shelves. She took out
some money and came back to the table.
Heres seventy pounds she said. Five ten pound notes and four five pound notes. Give your grandmother sixty pounds. I couldnt send the money to her before. But Ive worked hard and Ive saved it for her. The other ten pounds is for you. Your return journey will cost about three pounds. Use the other seven pounds when you go out. Ill put the money in this little bag. Now dont lose it Where will you put it
Emil thought for a minute then he put the bag into the pocket inside his jacket. Itll be safe there he said. His mother looked serious. You mustnt tell anyone on the train about the money Of course not said Emil.
Some people think that seventy pounds is not a large amount of money. But it was a lot of money to Emil and his mother. Emils father was dead so his mother worked hard all day. She paid for their food and clothes and for her sons books and his school. Emil realized that his mother worked hard. So he really tried to do well in class. She

4,17,O3,Ethan Frome,"If you know Starkfield Massachusetts you know the post office there. If you know the post office you have probably seen Ethan Frome driving up to it in his buggy and you have probably wondered who he was.
It was there that several years ago I saw him for the first time. He was a noticeable figure. His tall strong body was badly twisted and much shorter on the right side than on the left. He moved slowly and painfully pulling himself along. Just the few steps from his buggy to the post office were clearly difficult for him. His face had a sad grim look. It was the face and body of an old man and I was surprised to hear that he was only Fifty
two.
I learnt this from Harmon Gow a man who knew all the families around Starkfield.
Hes been like that since his bad accident nearly twenty four years ago said Harmon. But Fromes dont die young. Ethanll live to a hundred probably He looks like a dead man already I said. I guess hes been in Starkfield too many winters said Harmon. Most smart people get out of here. Why didnt he get out  asked. He had to stay and take care of his family. First his father got hurt then his mother fell sick then his wife And then the accident


Harmon gave a little smile.
Thats right. He had to stay then. Ethan Frome used to drive in from his farm every day at about midday and because I picked up my mail at about the same time I often saw him. He came to the post office only for a newspaper and sometimes for a packet from a medicine company for Mrs Zeena Frome
Starkfield people understood that he did not want to stop and talk and on most days Frome climbed slowly back into his buggy and drove away without a word to anyone.
At that time my company had sent me on an engineering job near Starkfield and I was staying at the home of a lady called Mrs Ruth Hale. Before she was married her name had been Ruth Varnum but her husband Ned Hale
was now dead and she had returned to live with her mother in the Varnum home. It was a grand house large and white with tall dark trees outside. Although it was clear that the Varnums no longer had much money theirs was still the finest house in the village.
Ruth Hale enjoyed talking about her neighbours and I hoped that she could tell me more about Ethan Frome. But when I asked her she just looked unhappy and said in a low voice
Yes I knew them both ... it was awful...
I asked other people and everybody in Starkfield agreed that Ethan Frome had had more troubles in his life than most people. But nobody explained why he had that sad grim look on his face.


In the end I learnt the story piece by piece from several people. As often happens the story was different each time but I slowly began to put it together. And my interest in Ethan Frome grew stronger when a little later  met the man himself.
It happened like this. Every day I had to travel about three miles to the station where I got my train to work. I usually hired a horse from Denis Eady the rich village shopkeeper. But in the middle of winter his and most of the other Starkfield horses caught an illness. For a day or two I could not find a horse to hire anywhere until Harmon Gow had an idea.
Why dont you ask Ethan Frome to drive you he said.
His horse aint sick and he needs a dollar or two. That Frome farm and saw mill dont make enough money to keep a cat alive. So Ethan Frome agreed to drive me and every day for a week I sat beside him in his sleigh as his thin horse pulled us over the hard snow to the station. Then in the icy evenings he brought me back to
Starkfield.

5,18,O6,Silas Marner,"In the early years of the nineteenth century strange looking little men were often seen on the country roads usually with a heavy bag on their shoulders.
They were linen weavers taking the linen they had woven to the women in the villages. Unlike the strong healthy country people they were small and thin with tired white faces bent backs and
round shoulders.
They were often shortsighted too because they had to look so closely at their work. To the villagers the weavers looked almost foreign and quite frightening.
Where did they come from Was it the devil who sent them Who were their parents How could you trust a man if you didnt know his father or mother Country people used to be very suspicious of all strangers and travellers.
They were also suspicious of clever people people who could do something they themselves had not learnt to do.
That is why the linen weavers who often moved from towns to live and work in the country were considered strangers all their lives by their neighbours and were sometimes very lonely as a result.
Silas Marner was one of these weavers. He lived in a small cottage near the village of Raveloe.


Every day he worked at his loom in the cottage.
The small boys of Raveloe had never heard the sound of a loom before and sometimes they used to run up to his house to look quickly in at the window.
If Silas noticed them he lifted his shortsighted eyes from the loom to stare at the boys. There was something terrible about his stare which made the boys run away at once screaming with fear.
The villagers believed that Silas had an almost devilish power which he could use to harm them if he wanted and so they were all afraid of him.
Raveloe was an important looking village with a fine old church and a number of large farms.
But it was at least an hour away from any other village and very few strangers visited it which explains why the villagers opinions were so out of date.
Silas Marner had first come to Raveloe fifteen years before as a young man. He and his way of life seemed very strange to the villagers. He worked long hours at his loom and had no friends or visitors from the village or anywhere else.
He never talked to his neighbours unless it was necessary for his work and he never looked at any of the Raveloe girls. Who would want to marry him anyway the girls laughed to each other.


Marry a dead man come to life again with that unhealthy white skin and those insect like eyes of his Certainly not One of the villagers had had a strange experience with Silas.
One evening he had discovered the weaver resting on a field gate his eyes open but unseeing and his body
After a few moments Silas appeared to wake up said Goodnight and walked away. When this was discussed in the village some people thought that Silas had had a fit. But others like Mr Macey the church clerk refused to accept a medical explanation. No he isnt ill that weaver said old Mr Macey shaking his head knowingly.
If he had a fit hed fall down wouldnt he I think his soul flies out of his body sometimes and thats why he looks so strange
He doesnt come to church does he And how does he know so much about medicines You all remember how he made Sally Oates better when the doctor himself could do no more for her
Thats the devils work believe me However the housewives needed Silas to weave their linen and they could find nothing wrong with his work.
The years passed and Raveloe villagers did not change their opinion of the weaver.",647,674,Oxford,10,0.446429,0.297619,0.297619,0.14881,0.14881,0.0,0.446429,0.297619,0.0,0.14881,1.339286,0.297619,0.297619,0.744048,0.595238,1.785714,0.446429,0.297619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.446429,3.125,0.892857,0.595238,0.14881,0.14881,0.0,0.0,0.297619,1.339286,0.297619,0.595238,0.446429,0.446429,1.636905,0.595238,0.446429,0.446429,0.446429,0.14881,0.446429,1.041667,0.744048,0.446429,0.595238,0.14881,0.0,0.892857,0.446429,0.297619,1.041667,0.446429,0.297619,0.595238,0.14881,1.636905,1.041667,0.297619,1.041667,0.14881,0.446429,0.14881,1.190476,0.297619,0.446429,0.446429,0.0,0.297619,1.339286,0.0,1.339286,0.595238,0.446429,0.0,0.0,0.14881,0.0,0.0,0.14881,0.892857,0.297619,0.744048,0.0,0.297619,0.297619,0.0,0.14881,0.595238,0.297619,0.0,0.0,0.14881,1.488095,0.446429,0.0,0.14881,0.0,0.14881,0.595238,0.0,0.14881,0.446429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.297619,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.297619,0.446429,0.297619,1.041667,0.892857,0.0,0.14881,0.446429,1.041667,0.14881,0.14881,0.297619,0.744048,0.14881,0.446429,0.446429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.744048,0.0,0.14881,0.297619,0.0,0.297619,0.0,0.297619,0.0,0.0,0.446429,0.14881,0.14881,0.297619,0.297619,0.446429,0.0,0.595238,0.14881,0.446429,0.14881,0.0,0.446429,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
6,19,C5,High Life Low Life,"It had been a long day. It was almost time for a cold beer.
Stella was reading at her desk. How are things Stella I asked. Everythings fine except that the office is too hot Stella replied. I cant work and Ive got a headache Message received. So everythings normal I said. Thats what I like to hear. What are you reading about
Air conditioning units. You know what they are   smart machines that cool down rooms. She held a picture
of one up.
Dream on These things cost money I said. The phone rang. It was Joe.
Nat Ive been watching Wiseman Cabs all afternoon. Theres a lot of movement in and out of that office. Cab drivers going in carrying one suitcase then coming out with a different one and driving away. Seem to be doing everything except carrying passengers
Interesting. I wonder what Wisemans up to The answers in those suitcases boss Did you get some photos I asked.


Used a whole roll of film. Its being developed now Joe replied. Well done. Therell be a cold beer with your name on it waiting at McFaddens
Why pay for a sauna when all you have to do is sit and sweat in your office Maybe Stella was right. She was usually right about a lot of things. I was just thinking about the cold beers when Dr. Fischer phoned from Bellevue Hospital. Annies condition was getting much worse.
How much longer has she got Doctor I asked.
Shes had heart trouble for years and then with that heart attack at the station Im seriously worried Mr. Marley
Is she still conscious Yes but only just
Well Ive got something that should make her hold on I said. Were looking for her son and getting closer. Weve found his old boss in the East Village. There seems to have been some argument between them. My guess is Jackies keeping away from him. Just tell her were getting close.
I felt both sad and angry as I put down the phone. Sad for the people who had to live out their lives on the
streets.
Angry about the society that put them on the streets.


Stella stopped reading and looked up. Whats the matter Nat Its Annie. If we dont find Jackie soon shes going to die without seeing him I said. Nat I got an idea.
Yeah
Why dont I phone every cab company in the book I could say Im Jackies ex girlfriend wanting to see him again to talk things over Stella said.
Good thinking. But first I need some food and beer. Ill see you in McFaddens after youve locked up.
Ed Winchester from the Daily News was watching me as I finished my first beer. It was cool and delicious and hardly touched the sides of my throat as it went down. I immediately felt better.
Nat what a thirst Now have I got something for you from the Daily News five years ago. But first ... I get it. The storys going to cost me another drink. This had better be good
Ed handed me a photocopy of a news story. The headline read Weissmann and Clayton Not Guilty I continued reading. Ernst Weissmann and Jackie Clayton walked free today after being found not guilty of buying and selling stolen property.
Thats it I said. Joe spent the afternoon watching what was going on at Wiseman Cabs. Jackie Clayton used


to work for Wiseman Cabs. In this story Jackie was with a guy called Weissmann. Maybe he changed his name to make it sound more American.
Joe had arrived with the photos. Picture after picture of cab drivers going in and out of the office with different suitcases. And a beautiful picture of Wiseman.
Thats him I said. Now if we compare him with the picture of Ernst Weissmann in the Daily News story.
Yeah its the same guy. And he doesnt get any prettier with age.",664,733,Cambridge,10,0.136799,0.0,0.0,0.136799,0.0,0.0,0.547196,0.547196,0.273598,0.0,1.367989,0.136799,0.136799,1.23119,0.820793,0.820793,0.136799,0.547196,0.547196,0.0,0.410397,1.094391,2.735978,0.683995,0.273598,0.410397,0.136799,0.136799,0.0,0.273598,1.23119,0.0,0.547196,0.547196,0.410397,1.094391,0.273598,0.273598,0.0,0.273598,0.136799,0.957592,0.957592,1.504788,0.683995,0.410397,0.273598,0.273598,0.820793,0.547196,0.273598,0.820793,0.273598,0.547196,0.273598,0.136799,1.094391,0.273598,0.410397,0.820793,0.0,0.547196,0.410397,0.683995,0.273598,0.410397,0.410397,1.23119,0.273598,1.094391,0.136799,0.820793,0.136799,0.273598,0.683995,0.273598,0.273598,0.273598,0.136799,0.273598,0.136799,0.136799,0.273598,0.0,0.410397,0.410397,0.136799,0.410397,0.0,0.0,0.136799,0.0,0.273598,0.410397,0.0,0.410397,0.410397,0.136799,0.136799,0.136799,0.0,0.0,0.410397,0.273598,0.136799,0.273598,0.136799,0.0,0.0,0.273598,0.273598,0.410397,0.410397,0.683995,0.136799,0.0,0.136799,0.136799,0.136799,0.273598,0.410397,0.820793,0.273598,0.136799,0.136799,0.136799,0.136799,0.273598,0.136799,0.0,0.136799,0.0,0.136799,0.0,0.0,0.273598,0.136799,0.410397,0.136799,0.273598,0.0,0.273598,0.136799,0.136799,0.136799,0.136799,0.136799,0.0,0.410397,0.136799,0.0,0.410397,0.136799,0.136799,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
7,20,O7,Brat Farrar,"Why cant you eat more politely Jane Like your sister Ruth said Bee across the lunch table.
Shes better at spaghetti than I am thats all said Jane. I cant be bothered with things like that. Her Aunt Bee looked along the table at the twins Jane and Ruth and smiled. They were almost ten and were exactly the same but it was never difficult to tell which was Jane and which was Ruth. Jane always seemed to wear old clothes clothes for riding horses and for working with them. Ruth on the other hand was always in a fresh clean dress her hands were never dirty and her hair was always neat and tidy.
Eight years thought Bee. Eight years since the sudden shocking death of the twins mother and father Nora and Bill in that terrible plane crash Eight years since she left her life and her job in London to come to Latchetts in order to look after her dead brothers children. And soon she would no longer be responsible for them. The twins brother Simon would be twenty one in a few weeks time and his mothers fortune would be his. The father had not been poor the Ashby family had lived comfortably at Latchetts for more than two hundred years but they had never been rich. Latchetts was a small estate of three farms the park and the house itself. Bills death had left his sister Bee with many problems as well as those of bringing up his children. Bee had refused to use the money that had belonged to Bills wife and had been determined to manage the estate as a successful business. The money would go to the oldest son when he was twenty one and Bee had decided not to touch it. So Latchetts had earned its living as a farm for horses as a school for training horses as a school for people who wanted to learn to ride


and each year Latchetts had made a profit. Bee had made sure of that.
And in six weeks time Simon would be twenty one would receive his mothers money and become master
of Latchetts.
What would he do with it wondered Bee as she watched his fair head across the lunch table.
Simon who had so much charm but who was also so selfish. He seemed so often to want help but always with such a charming manner that people helped him even before he asked. In fact it wasnt true that he was helpless it was just his way of making sure that he could get what he wanted. Unfortunately very few people except Bee seemed to understand this side of Simons character.
The twins older sister Eleanor came in. Oh you smell of horses said Ruth turning up her nose. What made you so late Eleanor asked Bee. Oh the Parslow girl from Clare. But its a waste of time trying to teach her. Shell never learn to ride Perhaps mad people cant ride suggested Ruth. Ruth said Bee firmly. The pupils at the school at Clare are not crazy. Theyre just ... difficult. Well they seem to be mad from what I see of them answered Ruth. Silence fell on the Ashby table. Bee thought about Latchetts the estate that would belong to Simon in a few


weeks. She hoped he would look after it well. It was the only local estate to have stayed in the same family for over two hundred years.
Even the big estate at Clare with its beautiful long white house had been sold. The Ledingham family had wasted their money and had not looked after their land. In the end they had had to sell the house where they had lived for so long but which had perhaps never really been a home for them. The house at Clare had become a school for difficult children with rich parents and the Ledinghams had gone.

8,21,E4,[practice]Come Home,"OK thats it for today says Mr. Babic. Read some more of your book for the next class.
The students put their books in their bags and start to go out of the classroom. Samorn doesnt get up. She puts her head on the table. This is very difficult she thinks. She loves Economics but here in the U.S. she has to study it in English. She isnt studying in Thai her language. Its difficult to understand everything. She looks at the other students in the class. They look happy. Theyre happy because they understand she thinks.
Samorn closes her eyes and starts to think about home. She thinks about Thailand where she lives. She thinks
about the hot weather about the nice food and about her friends. She remembers her mother and father her
sisters and brothers. She thinks about her boyfriend Lek and she wants to cry. Why am I here she thinks. This is only her first week at Brenton College but she wants to go home.
Samorn looks at her watch. Its just after eleven oclock. In Thailand its one oclock in the morning.
She goes out of the classroom and she walks to her room in the dorm. Its nice but cold. Its September and the trees are orange and brown. She sees students everywhere in twos and threes. Theyre laughing and talking as they walk to and from their classes. They all look happy.
Hi Samorn hears someone speaking and she looks. She sees a student from her class. Harrison his name is
she thinks.
Hello Samorn replies. She smiles a little but she doesnt look into Harrisons eyes.


Harrison is with some friends. Theyre all laughing at Harrison. Harrison is funny and he says funny things. She sees that in class. Hes good looking too and he looks rich. He wears good clothes. He comes from a very rich family she knows. Samorns family has money too   her mother and father are lawyers in Bangkok   but its not the same. Shes different from him from all of them. She walks to her dorm room at Evelyn Royce House. She looks at her room and thinks Is this really my home for the next four years",374,417,Cengage,3,0.240964,0.240964,0.0,0.240964,0.0,1.445783,2.409639,1.204819,0.0,0.0,0.240964,0.0,0.0,0.240964,0.481928,2.409639,1.204819,0.481928,0.481928,0.0,0.0,0.722892,1.686747,0.0,0.0,0.240964,0.0,0.240964,0.722892,0.0,0.240964,0.240964,0.0,0.240964,0.240964,1.445783,0.722892,0.240964,0.0,0.240964,0.481928,0.722892,2.891566,4.578313,0.481928,0.481928,0.0,0.240964,0.722892,0.722892,0.481928,0.0,0.0,0.481928,0.963855,0.481928,0.963855,0.481928,0.722892,0.963855,0.0,0.481928,0.722892,1.204819,0.0,0.240964,0.0,1.686747,0.481928,1.445783,0.0,0.481928,0.0,0.0,0.481928,0.722892,0.0,0.240964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.481928,1.445783,0.0,0.481928,0.722892,0.0,0.240964,0.0,0.0,0.240964,0.240964,0.481928,1.204819,0.0,0.722892,0.481928,0.0,0.0,0.963855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.240964,0.240964,0.0,0.240964,0.481928,0.0,0.0,0.240964,0.240964,0.0,0.240964,0.0,0.481928,1.204819,0.240964,0.481928,0.0,1.204819,0.0,0.240964,0.0,0.240964,0.0,0.240964,0.481928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.481928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.481928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.481928,0.0,0.240964,0.0,0.240964,0.240964,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
9,22,E2,The Beautiful Game,"Yes called Estela as she came off the field. Good win everybody. The soccer game was finished and captain
Estela Ramos and her team were the winners.
Great game she said to the young women in the team. They were tired but very happy. Estela was the captain of the team and a very good player. You were very good she said.
You too Estela said her friend Katy.
Ah I was OK she said. It wasnt her best game ever she knew but the team won so she wasnt worried about that.
Estela smiled at her friend. Then she walked to Coach George Gray. So how was that she asked smiling. Hmm. Not bad said the coach. They walked back to the locker rooms.
Not bad said Estela. We just won the cup Did you see it The coach was never happy she thought. It was a great win against Tacoma College a very good team. The girls worked really well together she said a little angry. We did OK didnt we
Well he said. The team won yes but you didnt play well Estela. You missed a lot of opportunities. And your passing   we must work on your passing. I need more from you ... Coach Gray went on for some minutes. Didnt I do anything right she asked when he finished. Her face was red now. She knew he was right and


that made it even worse.
The coach didnt speak. He seemed to be thinking about that. Aghh she said. She ran away from Coach Gray and into the locker room.

In the locker room Estela was really angry. We won she thought. Why cant he say something nice The other girls were happy and Estela tried to look happy too. She tried to forget about the coach. Were going to eat at Bens Estela said Katy. Coming No she said not now. Maybe Ill come later. OK said Katy. Then she and the other girls went to the café. Five minutes later Estela came out of the locker room. She didnt want to see Coach Gray again.
Gray wasnt there but when she came out of the door of the locker room Estela saw a man of about thirty years old with black hair. He wore a very smart dark blue suit and tie. The suit looked expensive she thought. He
was very good looking.",400,449,Cengage,4,0.223714,0.0,0.447427,0.447427,0.0,0.0,0.894855,0.447427,0.0,0.0,1.342282,0.0,0.0,0.894855,0.0,0.447427,0.223714,0.223714,0.223714,0.0,0.0,0.894855,2.46085,1.565996,0.671141,0.447427,0.447427,0.447427,0.0,0.671141,0.894855,0.223714,0.0,0.447427,0.447427,0.671141,0.671141,1.118568,0.223714,0.0,0.671141,0.894855,1.118568,3.131991,0.894855,0.447427,0.0,0.223714,0.447427,0.223714,0.0,1.342282,0.894855,0.223714,0.447427,0.671141,0.894855,1.789709,0.671141,0.894855,0.0,0.447427,0.223714,1.342282,1.118568,0.447427,0.447427,1.789709,0.0,1.342282,0.0,1.342282,0.223714,0.223714,0.671141,1.789709,0.223714,0.447427,0.223714,0.223714,0.0,0.671141,0.0,0.0,0.447427,0.0,0.223714,0.0,0.447427,0.223714,0.0,0.447427,0.0,0.223714,0.223714,0.0,0.447427,0.0,0.0,0.223714,0.223714,0.0,0.0,0.223714,0.0,0.671141,0.0,0.0,0.223714,0.223714,0.223714,0.223714,0.0,0.894855,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.223714,0.223714,0.223714,0.0,0.223714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.447427,0.0,0.0,0.447427,0.0,0.0,0.894855,0.223714,0.0,0.0,0.447427,0.223714,0.0,0.0,0.671141,0.223714,0.671141,0.223714,0.223714,0.223714,0.0,0.223714,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0

Not again thought Janine Cole. It was near the end of a busy lunchtime in the college canteen and Janine felt
tired. Janines manager Gayle King made her tired   she was always shouting.
Janine walked to the table near the window. As she walked across the room she looked at the clock on the wall. Two thirty. It was almost time to pick up Amber. Her little three year old girl was with the childminder. It cost money but it was the only way that Janine could work. She walked quicker.
She got to the table and started to put the dirty cups and plates onto her tray. So many plates she thought. Why couldnt students put their things away There was food on the blue table top. Im here to clean up after them she thought so they dont care. They dont know how lucky they are. She cleaned the table and picked up the tray. It was heavy but she started to walk back to the kitchen. Suddenly she felt someone run into her. Her tray of cups and plates fell to the floor with a loud crrrash Everyone in the room looked up.
Hey Janine shouted. It was a big tall young man with blond hair. Sorry he said.
Sorry Whatre you doing running around in here This is a canteen not a football field Janine was shouting and her face was red. Everyone was looking at her but she couldnt stop herself. You think you can just


run around everywhere and other people have to clean up after you
Im really sorry the young man said quietly. He started to pick things up and put them on the tray. Gayle King arrived. Im sorry about this she said to the young man. Please dont do that. We can do it.
Janine looked at the young man cleaning the mess up. She wanted to cry. But she didnt cry. She started to help him.
Really its no problem the young man said. It was me anyway.

12,25,C3,Presidents murder,"Run the man thought. Move Faster I cant stop now. Over the mans head the night sky was black and cold and in front of him were the trees. Tall dark trees ... five hundred metres away.
I can hide there the man thought. I can hide in those trees. They cant see me in the trees. He looked behind him. He could see the lights. There were five or six men. They ran fast and their lights moved up and down. They were not far away now. He could hear their feet on the ground.
The man ran faster. His legs were tired his body was tired. There were noises in his head he could not see. The trees were two hundred metres away. He wanted to stop running. He wanted to lie down and sleep.
Then he heard a new noise. Dogs.
Theyve got dogs he thought. Oh no Not dogs I cant run faster But he did. Faster and faster. The trees were a hundred metres away ... fifty ... twenty ...
And then he was there. The trees opened their dark arms to him. But he did not stop running. It was dark and quiet under the trees. He ran first to the left and then to the right. He came to a hill and for a second or two he stopped and listened.
Nothing. Then he heard the dogs again but he could not see the lights.
Dont stop now he thought. Dogs dont need eyes. They can find you in the dark. Quickly he ran down the hill. It was very dark here and he could not see very well. He ran into a tree and nearly broke his arm.


Careful he thought. Careful. He put his hands out in front of him and ran more slowly. Then he heard a
new noise.
Water.
A river he thought. The dogs cant follow me across water. Where is it Quick Soon he found the river. It
was not very big but it ran quickly.
The water was cold on his tired legs. He walked and ran up the river through the water for about two kilometres. Then he stopped and listened again.
He could hear nothing. He stood there and waited. The trees watched him with dark secret eyes.
Nothing. No dogs no lights no noises. The man was cold now and very very tired. I need sleep he thought. Where can I hide He looked up at
the trees.

Nothing.

13,26,C4,Apollos Gold,"It began with a visit to the doctor. You need a holiday the doctor told me. You need a rest.
I cant take a holiday I answered. Im too busy No Liz said the doctor. You dont understand. If you dont take a holiday youre going to get very very ill Im just tired I said. I feel tired No he said. Its more than that. Are you doing too much You teach dont you Well yes I said. Im teaching and studying archaeology at the university What else are you doing he asked me.
Im learning to speak Greek I replied. And Im writing a book
I see he said. Youre learning to speak Greek youre writing a book and youre working at the university. Dont you think thats too much How many hours do you sleep at night
Four or five hours most nights I told him. Its not enough he said. You need to slow down. Is your husband here in Greece with you the doctor
asked.
No I told the doctor. I was married but my husband left me. Last year I understand said the doctor. No I thought you dont really understand. Because you dont know that my husband left me and went to


live with one of his students. Because you dont know that I am still very angry. I am both angry and sad. You dont understand because you dont know that I had to leave London to be away from my husband who is still working at London University
Only a year ago everything was wonderful. I had a good job in London. I had a wonderful husband. I loved him and he loved me. Or I thought he loved me. But then I found out that he was actually in love with someone
else.
My wonderful world wasnt real.
But that was a year ago. Now I lived in Greece and had a job I enjoyed. And I had a wonderful kind boss Stavros. Stavros looks like a big animal and has a black beard. But hes a very good archaeologist. Sometimes I think that he can feel what is under the earth even before he begins to look for it. And hes very kind. I love
working for him.
After I left the doctors I went to see Stavros at the university.
Stavros is very big man but his office is so untidy that sometimes its hard to find him. As usual there were pots and bits of pots all over his desk. Stavros knows almost everything about Greek pots. Every day I spend with him I learn something. When I walked into his office he was looking through a magnifying glass. Oh I said. Youve got that pot again. Thats great. Stavros put down the magnifying glass.

Yes he replied. The police gave the pot to me this morning. Two men were trying to take it out of the country. The police caught them at the airport.
Thats wonderful I said. Its a lovely pot. It belongs here in Greece.

14,27,M1,David Copperfield,"My name is David Copperfield and I was born in the county of Suffolk in the east of England. This book is the story of my life. Will I be the hero of my own story You must read it and decide for yourself.
I never knew my father. He died before I was born. When this story begins my mother had been a widow for six months.
She was living in our big old house in a little village called Blunderstone. One afternoon in March my mother was sitting by the fire crying quietly to herself. Her baby would be born soon a baby that would never know its father. My mother felt lonely and sad.
The room was very quiet. Then suddenly there was a tapping sound at the window. My mother who was easily frightened looked up quickly.
There was an old lady in the garden. She was looking in at the window with her face pressed against the glass. My mother stood up and her heart began to beat very fast. She was so frightened that she almost fainted.
Who is it What do you want she whispered.
The old lady who was tall and thin tapped on the window again. She was wearing spectacles and her bonnet was very old fashioned. My mother who had now recognized the old lady hurried to open the front door.
The old lady spoke first. You must be Clara Mrs David Copperfield she said in a sharp voice. I am Miss Trotwood Miss Betsy


Trotwood. We havent met before. But Im sure you have heard of me. I am your late husbands aunt
Yes yes of course my mother replied. Please come in. Miss Betsy Trotwood followed my mother into the sitting room and sat down by the fire.
Your husband told you about me didnt he the old lady asked.
My mother nodded. Yes he did she said. My dear husband your nephew often talked about his Aunt Betsy. He spoke of you just before he died. My poor mother began to cry again.
Well here I am Miss Betsy said. Sit down child. Let me look at you. My mother was very pretty with a sweet pale face and long fair curls.
Aunt Betsy shook her head sadly and gently touched my mothers pretty hair. When are you expecting your child the old lady asked. You are not much more than a baby yourself. My mother began to cry more than ever.
Very soon she said. I am so frightened. I am afraid that I shall die and my baby too Nonsense Miss Betsy said. You wont die and neither will your little girl
The baby may be a boy my mother said quietly.
I dont think so Miss Betsy replied. Im sure that the baby will be a girl. Her name will be Betsy Trotwood Copperfield. I will help you look after her I will teach her to think for herself Thank you my mother whispered.",504,551,Macmillan,11,0.0,0.182149,0.546448,2.185792,0.364299,0.0,0.728597,1.457195,0.546448,0.0,1.275046,0.182149,0.182149,1.092896,0.546448,0.546448,0.728597,0.182149,0.0,0.0,0.364299,1.092896,2.003643,0.546448,1.092896,0.910747,0.910747,0.182149,0.546448,1.275046,2.367942,0.0,0.364299,0.546448,0.182149,0.728597,0.182149,0.364299,0.364299,0.182149,0.364299,0.546448,1.639344,1.821494,0.364299,0.364299,0.364299,0.910747,0.364299,0.546448,0.182149,0.728597,0.364299,0.182149,0.364299,0.364299,1.457195,0.546448,0.182149,0.728597,0.182149,0.0,0.0,0.910747,0.182149,0.182149,0.0,0.728597,0.0,0.910747,0.0,0.728597,0.364299,0.546448,0.546448,1.275046,0.728597,0.182149,0.0,0.546448,0.182149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.182149,0.182149,1.821494,0.0,0.182149,0.0,0.910747,0.182149,0.364299,0.546448,0.182149,0.0,0.182149,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.182149,0.182149,0.364299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.182149,0.182149,0.0,0.182149,0.728597,0.0,1.092896,0.364299,0.728597,0.546448,0.364299,1.275046,0.728597,0.182149,0.0,0.182149,0.182149,0.0,1.092896,0.0,0.0,1.092896,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.364299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.182149,0.546448,0.182149,0.910747,0.0,0.182149,0.0,0.910747,0.0,0.0,0.364299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.546448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
15,28,M2,Nelson Mandela,"Nelson Mandela was born into a divided country. The rulers of South Africa were white people whose ancestors came from Europe. They came to the country only a few hundred years earlier but the ancestors of the black majority had lived in South Africa for thousands of years.
The Dutch were the first Europeans to live in South Africa.
They arrived at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652. The Cape was a trading post. Dutch ships could stop there for fresh food and water. The people who lived in the area were called Hottentots and Bushmen. The Dutch wanted the Hottentots to work for them but the Hottentots refused. So the Dutch brought prisoners and slaves from Asia to work for them.
Soon more white people came. They wanted to live in the country and become farmers or Boers as they are called in Dutch. At first the Africans shared the land. But more white people came and they wanted more and more land. When the Europeans took land they expected to keep it forever. The Boers sometimes caught Africans to make them slaves. The Africans fought the Boers but they could not win against European weapons.
In the early 1800s the British took over the Cape from the Dutch. The British liked the warm weather and the good land for farming. Soon they were coming in large numbers. The Boers were not happy about this. The British had a different language and different ideas. The British made slavery illegal and gave equal rights to non whites. This made the Boers angry. In 1836 thousands of Boers gathered their slaves cattle and sheep and moved north.


They wanted to escape the British. During the journey the Boers fought many battles with the African tribes. The Xhosa Sotho and Zulu all tried to stop them but they only had spears and clubs. The Boers had guns. In one fight three thousand Zulus were killed near a river. Today that river is called Blood River.
The Boers moved north of the British and founded two independent countries Transvaal and the Orange Free
State.
The Boers did not think of themselves as Dutch anymore. They were Afrikaners they said the white tribe of Africa.
In the beginning the British were not interested in the Afrikaners. That changed when diamonds and gold were found in the late 1800s. Between 1880 and 1902 the British and Boers fought two wars. But Britain had more weapons and its army was more powerful. In 1910 the Union of South Africa became one country and a part of the British Empire. Before the war the British promised that all black Africans would be able to vote. However the new British leaders only gave votes to blacks living in the Cape. And most of these blacks could not take part in elections. Only white people could do that. So blacks in the Cape could vote   but only for white people. And many blacks in the rest of South Africa could not vote at all.",506,551,Macmillan,13,0.182149,0.182149,0.182149,0.364299,0.0,0.182149,0.546448,0.546448,0.0,0.182149,0.364299,0.364299,0.182149,0.910747,0.0,0.0,0.182149,0.364299,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.185792,0.182149,0.182149,0.182149,0.364299,0.0,0.364299,0.0,0.364299,0.364299,0.182149,0.364299,0.182149,1.092896,1.821494,0.364299,0.546448,0.728597,0.182149,1.092896,0.0,0.910747,0.182149,0.910747,0.0,0.0,0.910747,0.910747,0.546448,0.364299,0.364299,0.546448,0.0,0.0,1.821494,0.182149,0.546448,0.728597,0.182149,0.0,0.910747,1.639344,0.182149,0.728597,0.182149,0.0,0.364299,0.728597,0.0,0.0,0.364299,0.0,0.0,0.182149,0.182149,0.546448,0.0,0.182149,0.0,1.092896,0.0,0.0,1.275046,0.364299,0.0,0.364299,0.0,0.364299,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.092896,0.182149,0.0,0.0,0.364299,1.092896,0.910747,0.0,0.0,0.546448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.182149,0.0,0.364299,0.182149,0.182149,0.0,0.182149,0.0,0.0,0.364299,0.182149,0.0,0.728597,0.0,0.728597,0.364299,0.364299,0.546448,0.0,0.364299,0.0,0.364299,0.182149,0.182149,0.0,0.728597,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.092896,0.0,0.182149,0.0,1.457195,0.546448,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.728597,0.182149,2.003643,0.182149,0.0,0.0,0.182149,0.0,2.73224,0.0
16,29,M3,Moby Dick,"Some years ago on a wet and miserable November day I decided to get on a ship and sail to different parts of the world.
There was nothing to interest me on shore and I was feeling irritable and bad tempered. Whenever I feel like
this I know that it is time for me to go to sea again. Not as a passenger though.
For that you need money and I never have enough. Nor as a ships captain for I do not want to be responsible for other men.
It is as much as I can do to be responsible for myself. When I go to sea I go as an ordinary sailor.
So I packed my old bag and left Manhattan to go to New Bedford where I would get a boat to the island of Nantucket.
Why Nantucket Because this time I was going to look for work on a whaling ship It was my dream to hunt and catch a whale that magnificent and mysterious creature of the sea. And all the biggest and best whaling ships sailed out of Nantucket Island off the coast of Massachusetts.
I arrived in New Bedford on a Saturday night in December. I went straight to the docks but was disappointed to discover that the little boat for Nantucket had already sailed. There would not be another boat to the island until Monday. I had very little money with me for I had hoped to find a ship quickly. Now I had to find somewhere to eat


and sleep so I began to walk through the streets. Snow covered the ground and the ice cold wind blew into my face. I passed several inns but they looked too expensive so I went back down to the docks again.
Here in these dark and nearly empty streets were the cheapest places to get a bed for the night. After a time a sign appeared over my head in the darkness. It hung outside an old wooden building.
The place looked suitable so I pushed open the door and went inside. I stepped into a long badly lit room with blackened walls.
There were harpoons and spears fixed to the walls and a large painting of a whale and whaling ships. I found Peter Coffin the landlord and explained that I needed a room for two nights.
Every room and every bed is occupied Coffin told me. But you could share a bed with a harpooner. Are you going whaling
Yes I am I answered. Then youd better get used to sharing a bed he said. All right I replied. I was tired and it was too cold and dark to walk the streets in a strange town to look for

Soon after the landlord brought me a supper of meat and potatoes and boiling hot tea. It was very good.

17,30,O2,Picture of Dorian Gray,"I have put too much of myself into this painting.
Through the open windows of the room came the rich scent of summer flowers. Lord Henry Wotton lay back in his chair and smoked his cigarette. Beyond the soft sounds of the garden he could just hear the noise of London.
In the centre of the room there was a portrait of a very beautiful young man and in front of it stood the artist himself Basil Hallward.
Its your best work Basil the best portrait that youve ever painted said Lord Henry lazily. You must send it to the best art gallery in London. No Basil said slowly. No I wont send it anywhere. Lord Henry was surprised. But my dear Basil why not he asked.
What strange people you artists are You want to be famous but then youre not happy when you are famous. Its bad when people talk about you   but its much worse when they dont talk about you
I know youll laugh at me replied Basil but I cant exhibit the picture in an art gallery. Ive put too much of myself into it Lord Henry laughed.
Too much of yourself into it You dont look like him at all. He has a fair and beautiful face. And you   well you look intelligent of course but with your strong face and black hair you are not beautiful You dont understand me Harry replied Basil. Lord Henrys friends always called him Harry. Of course Im


not like him Basil continued. In fact I prefer not to be beautiful.
Dorian Grays beautiful face will perhaps bring him danger and trouble. Dorian Gray Is that his name asked Lord Henry. Yes. But I didnt want to tell you Why not
Oh I cant explain said Basil. When I like people a lot I never tell their names to my other friends. I love secrets thats all.
Of course agreed his friend. Life is much more exciting when you have secrets. For example I never know where my wife is and my wife never knows what Im doing. When we meet and we do meet sometimes we tell each other crazy stories and we pretend that theyre true
You pretend all the time Harry said Basil. I think that youre probably a very good husband but you like to hide your true feelings
Oh dont be so serious Basil smiled Lord Henry. Lets go into the garden
In the garden the leaves shone in the sunlight and the flowers moved gently in the summer wind. The two young men sat on a long seat under the shadow of a tall tree. Before I go said Lord Henry you must answer my question Basil. Why wont you exhibit Dorian Grays


portrait in an art gallery He looked at his friend and smiled. Please give me the real reason now. Not the answer that you gave me before
Harry when an artist feels strongly about a portrait it becomes a portrait of himself not of the sitter. The artist paints the face and body of the sitter but in fact he shows his own feelings. The reason why I wont exhibit this portrait is because Im afraid it shows the secret of my heart. Lord Henry laughed.",551,587,Oxford,8,0.512821,0.34188,0.17094,0.683761,0.17094,0.512821,0.17094,0.854701,0.854701,0.17094,1.196581,0.17094,0.34188,1.196581,0.512821,0.512821,0.512821,0.512821,0.0,0.512821,0.0,0.683761,2.564103,0.512821,0.683761,0.17094,0.17094,0.34188,0.683761,0.17094,2.051282,0.17094,0.683761,0.854701,0.512821,1.538462,0.512821,0.34188,0.34188,0.683761,0.17094,0.683761,0.34188,0.854701,1.025641,0.854701,0.34188,1.196581,0.683761,0.34188,0.34188,0.17094,0.512821,0.0,0.34188,0.17094,1.367521,0.854701,0.683761,0.512821,0.0,0.683761,0.0,0.683761,0.512821,0.0,0.17094,0.17094,0.0,0.34188,0.0,1.025641,0.512821,0.0,0.512821,0.17094,1.025641,0.683761,0.512821,0.512821,0.0,0.0,0.512821,0.0,0.17094,0.34188,0.17094,0.0,0.17094,0.17094,0.0,0.0,0.17094,0.683761,0.17094,0.512821,0.17094,0.0,0.17094,0.34188,0.34188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17094,0.0,0.0,0.17094,0.0,0.854701,1.025641,0.17094,0.512821,0.512821,0.34188,0.683761,0.17094,0.854701,0.0,0.34188,0.17094,0.17094,0.17094,0.0,0.17094,0.17094,0.0,0.512821,0.683761,0.0,0.17094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.512821,0.17094,0.512821,0.0,0.34188,0.0,0.0,0.17094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.17094,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.34188,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.512821,0.0,0.0
18,31,O4,Skyjack,"The air hostess smiled. Welcome aboard sir. Would you like a newspaper
Yes please. Carl took the newspaper and looked at his ticket. Im in seat 5F. Wheres that Its near the front of the plane sir. On the left there. By the window I see. Thank you very much Carl smiled back at the air hostess. She was young and pretty. Just like my daughter he thought.
He put his bag under his seat and sat down. His friend Harald sat beside him. They watched the other passengers coming onto the plane. Harald looked at his watch.
9.30 p.m. he said. Good. Were on time
Carl agreed. And in three hours well be home he said. Thats good. Weve been away for a long time. Youll be pleased to see your family wont you Harald
Harald smiled. Yes I will. Have you seen this sir He opened his bag and took out two small planes. These are for my sons. I always bring something back for them
How old are your sons Carl asked. Five and almost seven. The older one has a birthday tomorrow. Hell be very excited tonight then. Yes. I hope he gets some sleep.


The plane took off. Carl watched the lights of the airport grow smaller below them. Then the plane flew above the clouds and he could see the moon and the stars in the night sky. He lay back in his seat and closed his
eyes.
Later he woke up. Harald was asleep. Carl looked at his watch. It was midnight. He called the air hostess. Excuse me. What time do we arrive 11.30 p.m. local time sir. Thats about half an hour from now. Thank you. Carl changed the time on his watch. Anything else sir No I dont think so. Oh wait a minute   could I have a cup of coffee please
Yes of course sir He watched her bring the coffee. She walks like my daughter too he thought. And she is very young. She looks nervous not sure what to do
How long have you been an air hostess he asked. She smiled. Three months sir she said. Do you like it Yes I love it. Its very exciting. She smiled nervously. Will that be all sir Yes thank you

19,32,O5,Moonspinners,"It all started when the big white bird flew out of the shiny leaves and yellow flowers. It rose up suddenly and turned away towards the mountains. I followed it. What else could I do in the middle of such a bright April day at the foot of the White Mountains of Crete The road was hot and dusty but the valley was green and full of the sound of water.
The white wings which flew before me moved quickly in and out of the deep shadow of the trees and the air was full of the sweet smell of the lemon grove.
The car from Heraklion had stopped where the path for Agios Georgios leaves the road. I got out and turned to thank the American couple who had brought me this far. Mrs Studebaker looked out of the car window.
But are you going to be all right Youre sure this is the right place What does that sign say The sign was in Greek.
Its all right I laughed. Thats Agios Georgios and the village is not far away down this path. I had been in Athens since January of the year before. I worked as a very unimportant secretary at the British Embassy. I had always wanted to visit Greece and thought I was lucky at the age of twenty one to get any kind of job there. I had enjoyed my time in Athens and had worked hard to learn Greek.
I was going to spend Easter with my cousin Frances Scorby. She was coming with some friends who had hired a boat but she was going to leave them for a few days to be in Crete with me. We would join her friends


later.
Frances was forty a healthy looking strong woman who was also very understanding. My parents were both dead and I had lived with Frances for three years. She grows and sells rock plants. She also writes about plants and takes beautiful colour photographs of them. Therefore she was interested in the wonderful flowers which grow in Greece. She had asked me to find some quiet place with the simple peace and beauty of the real Greece and a clean comfortable hotel. And I believed I had found it.
Someone I knew in Athens had told me about Agios Georgios a small village on the south coast of Crete. It had everything we wanted. The owner of the one small hotel had been born in Crete but had lived in London for twenty years. He had run a successful restaurant there and made a lot of money and had now come home. He had bought the village coffee shop and the house next to it and was making them into a comfortable little hotel. A friend from his London restaurant had come to help him.
When I had telephoned the owner had explained that they were still building and painting and that there was nobody else there. However when he realized that we wanted somewhere simple and quiet he seemed pleased.
Frances and I had planned to take the plane from Athens to Crete on Monday evening and stay in Heraklion for one night. The next day we were going to take the bus to Agios Georgios.


However on Sunday Frances had telephoned me. The boat had been delayed. She begged me not to wait but to go to Crete and she would get there as soon as she could.

20,33,O8,Decline,"Mr Sniggs the Assistant Dean and Mr Postlethwaite the Domestic Bursar sat alone in Mr Sniggs room in Scone College. They were the only dons who were at home that evening. Their colleagues were at parties in Oxford or visiting friends or attending meetings at other colleges because it was the night of the annual Bollinger Club dinner always a difficult time for those responsible for university discipline.
In fact it is not accurate to call this an annual event because quite often so much trouble is caused that the
Club does not meet again for some years. There is tradition behind the Bollinger it takes its name from the famous champagne and past members include men who are now heads of royal families. The last dinner was three years ago. What a wild destructive night that had been This was the first meeting since then and old members had poured into Oxford from all over Europe especially for the occasion foreign royalty country gentlemen Scottish landowners smooth young businessmen ambitious lawyers and politicians  to join those who were currently students at this great university.
The party had already started. Mr Postlethwaite and Mr Sniggs could hear the sound of confused shouting and breaking of glass from Sir Alastair Digby Vane Trumpingtons rooms. They listened eagerly looking out of the window into the courtyard.
The fines said Mr Sniggs as he lit his pipe. Oh yes The fines theyll have to pay after this evening There is some excellent port that is only served to


dons when College fines have reached £50.
We shall have a week of it at least said Mr Postlethwaite. A week of College port Louder noises were now coming from Sir Alastairs rooms a frightening sound for those who have heard it before the hunting cry of the ancient English families. Soon they would all be rushing into the courtyard red faced and shouting ready for the real fun of the evening.
Dont you think it might be wiser if we turned off the light said Mr Sniggs. In darkness the two men crept to the window. The courtyard below was already a sea of scarcely recognizable
faces.
There must be fifty of them at least said Mr Postlethwaite. If only they were all members of the College Fifty of them at ten pounds each
Oh Itll be more if they attack the Chapel said Mr Sniggs. Oh please God make them attack the Chapel I wonder who the unpopular students are this year. The Bollinger always attack their rooms. I hope theyve been wise enough to go out for the evening
Theres Austen   he has a beautiful piano Im told. And Partridge will be another one. I think he collects French paintings


Lord Rending can afford to hunt but he collects teapots instead. And Sanders has won prizes for his poems you know.
Therell be a heavy bill for tonight just you see But I must say Id feel happier if some of our colleagues were here. The Bollinger cant see us from here can they
It was a lovely evening. They smashed Austens piano destroyed Partridges French paintings broke Sanders windows and Rendings teapots. Sir Alastair felt quite ill with excitement and had to be helped to his bed. It was half past eleven. Soon the evening would come to an end. But there was still something to look forward to.

24,45,P4,The Ghost of Izieu,"She didnt want to come Steve said Carol. And now she says that she can see ghosts. She looked out of the window on to the war memorial in the village square. Everything was silent. Her new husband called it a dusty French silence. Carol called it a dusty hot French silence. It was only April but it was almost too hot to move.
Ive tried very hard Carol continued. But she refuses to be my friend.
Ghosts asked Steve. He was here to rest after a heart attack. Already he was tired of healthy food no long walks no heavy drinking and no smoking. What sort of ghosts
Oh I didnt ask said Carol. Ghosts are ghosts. Well just have to be patient with her replied Steve. But its three years since her mother left you.
Steve answered her with a sad smile. Perhaps Elise isnt happy with you. But that doesnt mean that shes happy with her Mum. Things will get better.
You always say that said Carol. The girl hates me. Shes sixteen Carol Steve said. Shes unhappy. Youre new in our lives and shes not sure about you. When I look at her she jumps said Carol. When I come into the room she leaves it.
It was very nice to be in love Carol decided. But it was different being married and a stepmother. She picked up her bag of drawing and painting things. Im going out to paint.


Steve smiled at her. Dont get too friendly with any ghosts He tried to put his arm round her but she pushed him away.
Didnt I do that when I joined this family she said.
Elise woke up and there again was the same image in the same place. It was exactly the same as yesterday morning.
Its the light she thought. Grey light came from between the bedroom curtains like the light of an old black and white film. In it she could see boys and girls in coats. They were carrying packages and some had baggy over their shoulders. And was that an army lorry
She watched for a minute. Then she got up to look out. The village square was empty except for a few cars. Some birds flew above the war memorial in the early morning sun.
I cant explain it scientifically she thought. But Im guessing that the village square gets mirrored in the room. Its as simple as that. And the lorry Well thats the school bus in this little village. But why didnt I see the lorry drive away Why didnt I hear it
She stood at the window. The birds were on the war memorial now and on the ground in front of it. Could the birds be the schoolchildren Elise began to get dressed. So thats my excitement for the day she thought. This is going to be my most


boring holiday ever
She looked across at the village church.

25,47,E14,Joe Faust,"The streets of Manhattan were busy as usual. It was a late afternoon in October. Tall buildings stood outlined against a pale blue sky. On the twentieth floor of one of the tall buildings a man stood by an open window. He
looked down at the streets far below.
He took a deep breath.
He jumped.



Twenty four hours later Joe Faust sat at a desk in the same building. He was a few floors down from the twentieth floor. His tie was undone and his face was damp with sweat. Ive bought thousands of shares for my clients he thought and if that computer screen doesnt show a rise in their price soon Im in big trouble
Joe Faust was a city trader. He bought shares on the internet for his clients for as low a price as possible then he sold them for as high a price as possible. He was always looking for a profit. Joe and his company got a percentage of the profits he made for his clients. But Joe had spent all the money he had been allowed on the shares he saw on the screen in front of him. He was so confident they would make a profit that he had spent even more than he was allowed Joe knew it was risky. The company didnt like losing money. Not one bit.


Come on You just have to come up in price he shouted out to the screen. His hand was held over the computer keyboard. He was ready to push the key that would mean the sale of all the shares he had bought. If the
shares went down any more in price he could lose his job.
At last they didnt go down any more. But Joe didnt push the key yet. He waited for a few minutes. Come on he shouted. Finally the shares went up in price. They went up again. And again. And again. Then they stayed still.
Now Joe pushed down on the key and sold all the thousands of shares he had bought in an instant. Yes he yelled with delight. Oh yes
Joe was still laughing to himself when the phone rang. It was his boss Brad Benson. Joe I want you in my office now
I wonder what thats all about Joe thought to himself as he stood up. He hoped he wasnt in trouble. Even making money could get you into trouble if you didnt play by the rules. Unless of course you made enough. Joe fastened his tie and left.
A few minutes later Joe Faust was in the office of his boss Brad Benson. Brad Benson was sitting behind his oak desk. He was about forty years old. Most of the hair on his head was gone though he did have a thick brown


moustache growing on his upper lip. Joe admired the expensive Italian suit his boss was wearing. He wished hed
put on something better than his sports jacket.",503,546,Cengage,12,0.183824,0.0,0.367647,0.551471,0.0,0.183824,1.286765,0.919118,0.0,0.0,1.286765,0.183824,0.183824,1.838235,1.470588,1.654412,0.367647,0.367647,0.367647,0.0,0.183824,0.919118,2.389706,0.551471,0.183824,0.367647,0.367647,0.0,0.0,0.183824,1.654412,0.0,0.735294,0.919118,0.551471,0.735294,0.0,0.183824,0.367647,0.0,0.0,1.286765,1.654412,2.573529,0.735294,0.919118,0.183824,0.183824,0.367647,0.367647,0.183824,1.102941,0.367647,0.735294,0.367647,0.183824,1.838235,0.551471,0.0,0.183824,0.183824,0.183824,0.0,2.022059,0.735294,0.551471,0.0,0.367647,0.0,0.551471,0.0,0.735294,0.551471,0.0,0.367647,0.367647,0.0,0.367647,0.183824,0.551471,0.367647,0.0,0.183824,0.0,0.183824,0.367647,0.367647,0.367647,0.183824,0.0,0.183824,0.367647,0.0,1.470588,0.367647,0.183824,0.367647,0.0,0.367647,0.0,0.0,0.367647,0.0,0.183824,0.0,0.0,0.367647,0.0,0.367647,0.367647,0.183824,0.551471,0.735294,0.367647,0.0,0.0,0.367647,0.0,0.551471,0.183824,0.551471,0.551471,0.183824,0.0,0.0,0.367647,0.183824,0.0,0.0,0.183824,0.0,0.367647,0.367647,0.0,0.0,0.183824,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.919118,0.0,0.183824,0.0,0.735294,0.183824,0.0,0.735294,0.0,0.0,0.551471,0.0,0.919118,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.183824
26,48,E13,Reunited,"Meg stood with her hands in her pockets looking out of the studio window. The heater wasnt working and she had a blanket over her shoulders to keep out the cold. The wind was coming up from the lake and blowing around
the outside of the studio. She watched her husband Ben as he played in the garden with Jack their two year
old son. Father and son both wore ski jackets to keep out the cold. Jack laughed as Ben lifted him high into the air. Their brown and white dog ran over and jumped up wanting to play.
Meg wanted to go out and join in the game. Instead she glanced over her shoulder at her unfinished painting. It was in the center of the studio waiting for her. She knew she should get back to work but still she stayed by the window. Her husband waved and carried their son in the direction of the lake. Meg smiled at her sons shouts of delight he loved the water.
With a sigh Meg turned and walked back to the painting. It was nearly finished she knew but she wasnt satisfied. The picture showed the covered bridge that Meg could see from her studio window. She looked out of the window at the river as it reflected the cold morning sky. Then she studied the painting again. It needed more white she thought. Picking up her paintbrush she started to paint.
The wooden bridges were famous in New Hampshire. Tourists came from all over the world to see them. Meg first got interested in them eight months earlier when she and Ben moved to the area from New York. Now most of


her paintings were of the bridges in different seasons and different lights.
By the time she finished painting it was almost one oclock. She stood back and studied the picture it wasnt perfect but it was certainly better. She washed the paint from her hands and was drying them when the telephone
rang. Putting down the towel she answered it.
Meg Ive got some great news announced the voice on the other end of the line.
Hi Gloria whats got you so excited Meg asked smiling at the sound of her friends voice. Gloria was a cheerful forty five year old who owned a gallery in town where Meg sold her paintings.
You know Avant Garde Magazine Avant Garde Isnt that an art magazine
Not an art magazine Meg its the art magazine   one of the most important in New York. Gloria didnt wait for Meg to reply before continuing breathlessly And they want to interview you.
Me Megs eyes were wide There must be some mistake. No theres no mistake. They called me a minute ago.
But why do they want to interview me Meg sat down on an old chair next to the window and brushed her dark hair back from her face.",486,525,Cengage,12,0.382409,0.0,0.0,0.573614,0.0,0.382409,0.956023,0.956023,0.191205,0.0,1.720841,0.0,0.0,2.294455,0.956023,2.10325,0.382409,0.573614,0.764818,0.0,0.0,0.764818,4.780115,0.764818,0.191205,0.0,0.191205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.382409,0.0,0.573614,0.956023,1.147228,1.338432,0.382409,0.573614,0.0,0.191205,0.0,0.573614,1.529637,1.912046,1.147228,0.573614,0.191205,0.382409,0.191205,0.382409,0.0,0.956023,0.764818,0.0,0.191205,0.0,1.147228,0.382409,0.382409,0.764818,0.0,0.573614,0.191205,2.10325,0.764818,0.191205,0.191205,0.191205,0.0,2.10325,0.573614,0.764818,0.764818,0.191205,0.191205,0.0,0.191205,0.573614,0.191205,0.191205,0.0,0.573614,0.382409,0.0,0.573614,0.573614,0.382409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.382409,0.382409,0.0,0.573614,0.0,0.0,0.191205,0.191205,0.191205,0.0,0.0,0.382409,0.0,0.382409,0.0,0.573614,0.191205,0.0,0.191205,0.191205,0.0,0.191205,0.573614,0.573614,0.382409,0.0,0.191205,0.0,0.573614,0.191205,0.0,0.191205,0.573614,0.0,0.573614,0.573614,0.0,0.191205,0.573614,0.382409,0.191205,0.191205,0.382409,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.191205,0.0,0.0,0.382409,0.0,0.191205,0.0,0.191205,0.191205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.382409,0.0,0.191205,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.191205

Hi my names Gavin the man said getting out of the boat. Gavin Rochester. This is my wife Danielle.

33,60,G3,The House in the Water,"UPON the moonlit stillness came suddenly a far off muffled crashing sound. Just once it came then once again the stillness of the wilderness night the stillness of vast untraversed solitude. The Boy lifted his eyes and glanced across the thin reek of the camp fire at Jabe Smith who sat smoking contemplatively. Answering the glance the woodsman muttered old tree fallin and resumed his passive contemplation of the sticks glowing keenly in the fire. The Boy upon whom as soon as he entered the wilderness the taciturnity of the woodsfolk descended as a garment said nothing but scanned his companions gaunt face with a gravely incredulous smile.
So wide spread and supreme was the silence that five seconds after that single strange sound had died out it seemed somehow impossible to believe it had ever been. The light gurgle of the shallow and shrunken brook which ran past the open front of the travellers lean to served only to measure the stillness. Both Jabe and the Boy since eating their dinner had gradually forgotten to talk. As the moon rose over the low fir crested hills they had sunk into reverie watching the camp fire die down.
At last with a sort of crisp whisper a stick burnt through the middle fell apart and a flicker of red flame leaped up. The woodsman knocked out his pipe rose slowly to his feet stretched his gaunt length and murmured Reckon we might as well turn in.
Thats all right for you Jabe answered the Boy rising also tightening his belt and reaching for his rifle but Im going off to see what I can see. Nights the time to see things in the woods.


Jabe grunted non committally and began spreading his blanket in the lean to. Dont forgit to come back for breakfast thats all he muttered. He regarded the Boy as a phenomenally brilliant hunter and trapper spoiled by
sentimental notions.
To the Boy whose interest in all pertaining to woodcraft was much broader and more sympathetic than that
of his companion Jabes interpretation of the sound of the falling tree had seemed hasty and shallow. He knew
that there was no better all round woodsman in these countries than Jabe Smith but he knew also that Jabes
interest in the craft was limited pretty strictly to his activities as hunter trapper and lumberman. Just now he was
all lumberman. He was acting as what is called a timber cruiser roaming the remoter and less known regions of the wilderness to locate the best growths of spruce and pine for the winters lumbering operations and for the present his keen faculties were set on the noting of tree growths and water courses and the lay of the land for the getting out of a winters cutting. On this particular cruise the Boywho for all the disparity in their years and the divergence in their views was his most valued comradehad accompanied him with a special object in view. The region they were cruising was one which had never been adequately explored and it was said to be full of little unnamed unmapped lakes and streams where in former days the Indians had had great beaver hunting.
When the sound of the falling tree came to his ears across the night silence the Boy at once said to himself Beavers at work He said it to himself not aloud because he knew that Jabe also as a trapper would be


interested in beavers and he had it in his mind to score a point on Jabe. Noiseless as a lynx in his soft soled Iarrigans he ascended the half empty channel of the brook which here strained its shrunken current through
rocks and slate slabs between steep banks. The channel curved steadily rounding the shoulder of a low ridge.
When he felt that he had travelled somewhat less than half a mile he came out upon a bit of swampy marsh
beyond which over the crest of a low dam spread the waters of a tranquil pond shining like a mirror in the moonlight.
The Boy stopped short his heart thumping with excitement and anticipation. Here before him was what he
had come so far to find. From his books and from his innumerable talks with hunter and trapper he knew that the dam and the shining lonely pond were the work of beavers. Presently he distinguished amid the sheen of the water a tiny grassy islet with a low dome shaped stick covered mound at one end of it. This plainly was a beaver house the first he had ever seen. His delighted eyes observing it at this distance at once pronounced it immeasurably superior to the finest and most pretentious muskrat house he had ever seen a very palace indeed by comparison. Then a little further up the pond and apparently adjoining the shore he made out another dome shaped structure broader and less conspicuous than the first and more like a mere pile of sticks. The pond which was several acres in extent seemed to him an extremely spacious domain for the dwellers in these two houses.


Presently he marked a black trail as it were moving down in the middle of the radiance from the upper end of the pond. It was obviously the trail of some swimmer but much too broad it seemed to be made by anything so small as a beaver. It puzzled him greatly. In his eagerness he pushed noiselessly forward seeking a better view till he was within some thirty feet of the dam. Then he made out a small dark spot in the front of the trail   evidently a beavers head and at last he detected that the little swimmer was carrying a bushy branch one end held in his mouth while the rest was slung back diagonally across his shoulders.

34,61,G2,The Backwoods of Canada,"Brig Laurel River St. Laurence
August 6 1832.
I left off writing my dear mother from this simple cause I had nothing to say. One day was but the echo as it were of the one that preceded it so that a page copied from the mates log would have proved as amusing and
to the full as instructive as my journal provided I had kept one during the last fortnight.
So barren of events has that time been that the sight of a party of bottlenosed whales two or three seals and a porpoise possibly on their way to a dinner or tea party at the North Pole was considered an occurrence of great importance. Every glass was in requisition as soon as they made their appearance and the marine monsters were well nigh stared out of countenance. We came within sight of the shores of Newfoundland on the 5th of August just one month from the day we took our last look of the British Isles. Yet though the coast was brown and rugged and desolate I hailed its appearance with rapture. Never did anything seem so refreshing and delicious to me as the land breeze that came to us as I thought bearing health and gladness on its wings.
I had noticed with some curiosity the restless activity of the captains bird some hours previous to land being proclaimed from the look out station. He sang continually and his note was longer clearer and more
thrilling than heretofore the little creature the captain assured me was conscious of the difference in the air as
we approached the land. I trust almost as much to my bird as to my glass he said and have never yet been


deceived.
Our progress was somewhat tedious after we entered the gulf. Ninety miles across is the entrance of this
majestic river it seems an ocean in itself. Half our time is spent poring over the great chart in the cabin which
is constantly being rolled and unrolled by my husband to gratify my desire of learning the names of the distant shores and islands which we pass. We are without a pilot as yet and the captain being a cautious seaman is unwilling to risk the vessel on this dangerous navigation so that we proceed but slowly on our voyage.
August 7. We were visited this morning by a beautiful little bird not much larger than our goldcrested wren. I hailed it as a bird of good omen a little messenger sent to bid us welcome to the New World and I felt almost a childish joy at the sight of our little visitor. There are happy moments in our lives when we draw the greatest pleasure from the most trifling sources as children are pleased with the most simple toy. From the hour we entered the gulf a perceptible change had taken place in all on board. The captain a man of grave quiet manners grew quite talkative. My husband was more than usually animated and even the thoughtful young Scotchman became positively an entertaining person. The crew displayed the most lively zeal in the performance of their duty and the goldfinch sung cheerily from dawn till sunset. As for me Hope was busy in my heart chasing from it all feelings of doubt or regret that might sadden the present or cloud the future.


I am now able to trace distinctly the outline of the coast on the southern side of the river. Sometimes the high lands are suddenly enveloped in dense clouds of mist which are in constant motion rolling along in shadowy billows now tinted with rosy light now white and fleecy or bright as silver as they catch the sunbeams. So rapid are the changes that take place in this fog bank that perhaps the next time I raise my eyes I behold the scene changed as if by magic. The misty curtain is slowly drawn up as if by invisible hands and the wild wooded mountains partially revealed with their bold rocky shores and sweeping bays. At other times the vapoury volume dividing moves along the valleys and deep ravines like lofty pillars of smoke or hangs in snowy draperies among the dark forest pines.
Tam never weary of watching these fantastic clouds they recall to me the pleasant time I spent in the Highlands among the cloud capped hills of the north.
As yet the air is cold and we experience frequent squalls of wind and hail with occasional peals of thunder then again all is serene and bright and the air is filled with fragrance and flies and bees and birds come flitting past us from the shore.",783,818,Gutenburg,16,0.245098,0.0,0.122549,0.612745,0.0,0.245098,0.857843,0.490196,0.0,0.0,1.838235,0.735294,0.245098,2.45098,0.490196,1.22549,0.245098,0.367647,0.122549,0.0,0.0,0.612745,3.308824,0.490196,0.612745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.245098,0.367647,0.490196,0.245098,0.980392,0.0,3.063725,0.612745,0.367647,0.367647,0.367647,0.245098,0.612745,0.735294,0.857843,0.857843,0.367647,0.0,0.367647,1.470588,0.245098,0.0,0.490196,0.0,0.612745,0.245098,0.367647,2.45098,0.122549,0.0,0.122549,0.122549,0.980392,0.0,0.857843,0.122549,0.367647,0.0,0.122549,0.122549,0.857843,0.0,1.22549,0.612745,0.0,0.245098,0.245098,0.0,0.245098,0.0,0.0,0.612745,0.0,0.245098,0.0,0.0,0.490196,0.367647,0.490196,0.245098,0.490196,0.0,0.490196,0.490196,1.22549,0.367647,0.0,0.122549,0.0,0.0,0.490196,0.0,0.490196,0.245098,0.0,0.0,0.122549,0.367647,0.122549,0.0,0.122549,0.122549,0.122549,0.0,0.612745,0.612745,0.490196,0.0,0.245098,0.490196,0.122549,0.122549,0.612745,0.490196,0.0,0.122549,0.612745,0.122549,0.0,0.245098,0.612745,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.122549,0.0,0.0,0.122549,0.490196,0.0,0.122549,0.0,0.490196,0.980392,0.0,0.0,0.122549,0.245098,0.0,0.0,0.122549,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0
35,62,G1,Roughing it in the bush,"THE dreadful cholera was depopulating Quebec and Montreal when our ship cast anchor off Grosse Isle on the 30th of August 1832 and we were boarded a few minutes after by the health officers. One of these
gentlemen a little shrivelled up Frenchman from his solemn aspect and attenuated figure would have made
no bad representative of him who sat upon the pale horse. He was the only grave Frenchman I had ever seen and I naturally enough regarded him as a phenomenon. His companion a fine looking fair haired Scotchman though a little consequential in his manners looked like one who in his own person could combat and vanquish all the evils which flesh is heir to. Such was the contrast between these doctors that they would have formed very good emblems one of vigorous health the other of hopeless decay.
Our captain a rude blunt north country sailor possessing certainly not more politeness than might be expected in a bear received his sprucely dressed visitors on the deck and with very little courtesy abruptly bade them follow him down into the cabin.
The officials were no sooner seated than glancing hastily round the place they commenced the following dialogue
From what port captain
Now the captain had a peculiar language of his own from which he commonly expunged all the connecting links. Small words such as and and the he contrived to dispense with altogether.


Scotland sailed from port o Leith bound for Quebec Montreal general cargo seventy two steerage four cabin passengers brig ninety two tons burden crew eight hands. Here he produced his credentials and handed them to the strangers. The Scotchman just glanced over the documents and laid them on the table.
Had you a good passage out
Tedious baffling winds heavy fogs detained three weeks on Banks foul weather making Gulf short of water people out of provisions steerage passengers starving.
Any case of sickness or death on board  All sound as crickets. Any births lisped the little Frenchman.
The captain screwed up his mouth and after a moments reflection he replied Births Why yes now I think ont gentlemen we had one female on board who produced three at a birth.
Thats uncommon said the Scotch doctor with an air of lively curiosity. Are the children alive and well I should like much to see them. He started up and knocked his head for he was very tall against the ceiling. Confound your low cribs  I have nearly dashed out my brains.
A hard task that looked the captain to me. He did not speak but I knew by his sarcastic grin what was uppermost in his thoughts. The young ones all malesfine thriving fellows. Step upon deck Sam Frazer turning


to his steward bring them down for doctors to see. Sam vanished with a knowing wink to his superior and quickly returned bearing in his arms three fat chuckle headed bull terriers the sagacious mother following close at his heels and looked ready to give and take offence on the slightest provocation.
Here gentlemen are the babies said Frazer depositing his burden on the floor. They do credit to the nursing of the brindled slut.
The old tar laughed chuckled and rubbed his hands in an ecstacy of delight at the indignation and
disappointment visible in the countenance of the Scotch Esculapius who angry as he was wisely held his tongue.
Not so the Frenchman his rage scarcely knew bounds he danced in a state of most ludicrous excitement he shook his fist at our rough captain and screamed at the top of his voice
Sacré you bête  You tink us dog ven you try to pass your puppies on us for babies Hout man dont be angry said the Scotchman stifling a laugh you see tis only a joke
Joke me no understand such joke. Bête returned the angry Frenchman bestowing a savage kick on one of the unoffending pups which was frisking about his feet. The pup yelped the slut barked and leaped furiously at the offender and was only kept from biting him by Sam who could scarcely hold her back for laughing the captain was uproarious the offended Frenchman alone maintained a severe and dignified aspect. The dogs were at length dismissed and peace restored.",699,748,Gutenburg,18,0.536193,0.0,0.0,0.268097,0.134048,0.134048,0.536193,0.80429,0.536193,0.0,0.938338,0.268097,0.268097,1.340483,1.206434,1.206434,0.670241,0.0,0.268097,0.0,0.134048,0.402145,3.217158,0.670241,0.268097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.134048,0.268097,0.0,0.402145,1.072386,0.268097,1.474531,1.474531,0.938338,0.402145,0.268097,0.402145,1.072386,0.670241,0.402145,0.268097,1.072386,0.134048,0.670241,0.670241,0.268097,0.0,0.268097,0.134048,0.134048,0.0,0.0,1.876676,0.268097,0.268097,0.268097,0.0,0.0,0.134048,0.670241,0.268097,0.402145,0.134048,0.0,0.134048,1.340483,0.134048,1.206434,0.402145,0.0,0.268097,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.268097,0.268097,0.268097,0.402145,0.0,0.134048,0.536193,0.402145,0.670241,0.134048,0.0,0.402145,0.0,0.134048,0.536193,0.402145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.268097,0.0,0.0,0.402145,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.670241,0.134048,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.268097,0.536193,0.268097,0.268097,0.536193,0.0,0.402145,1.072386,0.134048,0.80429,0.80429,0.80429,0.0,0.134048,0.536193,0.0,0.134048,0.0,0.134048,0.0,0.0,0.134048,0.268097,0.134048,0.134048,0.0,0.0,0.134048,0.134048,0.402145,0.0,0.0,0.268097,0.402145,0.0,0.268097,0.402145,0.134048,0.0,0.0,0.268097,0.0,0.0,0.134048,0.0,0.0,0.0
