Anna did not sleep all night. She was excited. Early in the morning, her father called her. 'Come on, Anna! It's time to get up. It's a long way to the station.' Anna got dressed and she was soon ready. She did not eat any breakfast. She was nervous. She was going to visit her aunt in Naira. She was going alone in a train for the first time. Anna and her father left the village and began to walk to the station. It was a long way. They reached the station at midday. 3 Soon the train came. It was nearly empty. Anna got in. She was frightened. It was her first journey away from home. 'Your aunt will meet you at Naira,' her father said. 'Be careful now, Anna. Don't talk to any strangers.' The train started suddenly. Soon it was going fast. Anna watched her father. He looked smaller and smaller; then he disappeared. The train journey was very long. Anna looked out of the window. The fields, trees, villages and animals rushed past. After a long time, she began to feel sleepy. She was very tired. Slowly, she fell asleep. Later, Anna woke up. It was dark outside. She felt small and lost. She was a long way from her village and her father.
