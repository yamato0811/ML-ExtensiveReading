'Run,' the man thought. â€œMove! Faster! I can't stop now.' Over the man's head the night sky was black and cold, and in front of him were the trees. Tall, dark trees ... five hundred metres away.
'I can hide there, the man thought. 'I can hide in those trees. They can't see me in the trees. He looked behind him. He could see the lights. There were five or six men. They ran fast, and their lights moved up and down. They were not far away now. He could hear their feet on the ground.
The man ran faster. His legs were tired, his body was tired. There were noises in his head, he could not see. The trees were two hundred metres away. He wanted to stop running. He wanted to lie down and sleep.
Then he heard a new noise. Dogs.
'They've got dogs!' he thought. 'Oh no! Not dogs! I can't run faster' But he did. Faster and faster. The trees were a hundred metres away ... fifty ... twenty ...
And then he was there. The trees opened their dark arms to him. But he did not stop running. It was dark and quiet under the trees. He ran first to the left, and then to the right. He came to a hill, and for a second or two he stopped and listened.
Nothing. Then he heard the dogs again, but he could not see the lights.
'Don't stop now,' he thought. 'Dogs don't need eyes. They can find you in the dark.' Quickly he ran down the hill. It was very dark here, and he could not see very well. He ran into a tree and nearly broke his arm.


'Careful!' he thought. Careful. He put his hands out in front of him, and ran more slowly. Then he heard a
new noise.
Water.
'A river!' he thought. 'The dogs can't follow me across water. Where is it? Quick!' Soon he found the river. It
was not very big, but it ran quickly.
The water was cold on his tired legs. He walked and ran up the river, through the water, for about two kilometres. Then he stopped and listened again.
He could hear nothing. He stood there and waited. The trees watched him with dark, secret eyes.
Nothing. No dogs, no lights, no noises. The man was cold now, and very, very tired. 'I need sleep, he thought. 'Where can I hide?' He looked up at
the trees.
Up there,' he thought. 'The dogs can't follow me up a tree! He found a tall tree and went up it. He could not see the ground now. He half sat, half stood in the tree, and listened.
Nothing.
'An hour,' he thought. 'Sleep for an hour. Then go on. Go south. Hide in the day, and move at night. I can get there in five days, perhaps six! The man put his head down on his arms, and slept.
