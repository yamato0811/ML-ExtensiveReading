It is Monday evening. Sara's father is
counting his money. He is happy. But
Sara is not happy. She is angry.

Father! You must sell the correct weight.
You mustn't cheat our customers.
Our customers are poor.

But we are poor too, Sara! My wife is dead.
You have no mother. I have no sons. You
have no brothers. We must make money,
Sara! That's life!

I don't want to work at the
market, father.

You must work at the market! We must
live, Sara. We must eat! You're a child.
You don't understand business. You're
a woman. Women don't understand
business. That's life, Sara!

It is Tuesday morning. Today, Sara's
father is selling the correct weight. He is
honest. He takes the correct money.

Sara is happy. Today, she is proud of
her father.

The customers are happy too. They buy
a lot of fruit. 'Your fruit is cheap and
fresh,' they say.

But in the afternoon, some customers
come back. They are angry.

An old man brings back some apples.
One of his apples is bad. A girl brings
back some oranges. One of her oranges
is bad. A woman brings back some
bananas. One of her bananas is bad. It
is black, and full of worms.

'Look, Mister Fruit! Your fruit isn't
fresh today. We want our money back!'

But Mister Fruit does not listen. He
does not give them any money.

'You're dishonest, father!' says Sara.
'You're cheating the customers! I 'don't
want to work for you. I don't want to
work at the market!'

'But you must work for me, Sara,' says
her father. 'I have no family! I have no
wife, and no sons. Children must help
their parents. You are my daughter,
Sara. You must work for me. That's life!'

'No, father,' says Sara. 'I don't want to
clean your house. I want to leave home.
I don't want to cook your food. I want
to get a good job! I'm not going to work
for you.'

Sara's father is angry. 'Go to bed!' he
shouts at her.

Sara goes to bed. She is lonely. She is
unhappy. She says a prayer.

Please, help me. Please, help my
father! Please, help us!

What am I going to do?
I need a miracle. Help me!

It is Wednesday morning. Everybody is
at the market. Everybody is laughing.
Something strange is happening.

Mister Fruit touches an apple. The apple
goes bad. Then he picks up an orange.
The orange goes bad too. Then he picks
up some bananas. They go black.

Everybody laughs. 'Look at Mister Fruit!
He touches the fruit and it goes bad!'

Mister Fruit looks at his hands. 'What is
happening?' he says. 'Please, Sara.
Please help me.'

Sara touches an apple. She picks up an
orange and some bananas.

'Hooray!' everybody says. 'It's a
miracle! Sara touches the fruit and it's
OK! We're going to buy our fruit from
Sara!'

Next year, Mister Fruit is Miss Fruit.

always sells the correct weight. She sells
good, fresh fruit. She understands
business.
