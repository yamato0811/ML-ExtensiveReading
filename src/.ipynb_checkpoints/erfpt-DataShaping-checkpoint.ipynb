      "['It began with a visit to the doctor. You need a holiday, the doctor told me. You need a rest.\\'\\n\\'I can\\'t take a holiday,\\' I answered. I\\'m too busy! \\'No, Liz, said the doctor. “You don\\'t understand. If you don\\'t take a holiday, you\\'re going to get very, very ill! I\\'m just tired,\\' I said. \\'I feel tired! \\'No,\\' he said. \\'It\\'s more than that. Are you doing too much? You teach, don\\'t you?\\' \\'Well, yes, I said. I\\'m teaching and studying archaeology at the university! \\'What else are you doing?\\' he asked me.\\nI\\'m learning to speak Greek,\\' I replied. “And I\\'m writing a book!\\n\\'I see,\\' he said. You\\'re learning to speak Greek, you\\'re writing a book and you\\'re working at the university. Don\\'t you think that\\'s too much? How many hours do you sleep at night?\\'\\n\\'Four or five hours most nights,\\' I told him. It\\'s not enough,\\' he said. “You need to slow down. Is your husband here in Greece with you?\" the doctor\\nasked.\\n\\'No, I told the doctor. I was married but my husband left me. Last year! \\'I understand, said the doctor. \\'No, I thought, \\'you don\\'t really understand. Because you don\\'t know that my husband left me and went to\\n\\n\\nlive with one of his students. Because you don\\'t know that I am still very angry. I am both angry and sad. You don\\'t understand because you don\\'t know that I had to leave London to be away from my husband who is still working at London University!\\nOnly a year ago everything was wonderful. I had a good job in London. I had a wonderful husband. I loved him and he loved me. Or, I thought he loved me. But then I found out that he was actually in love with someone\\nelse.\\nMy wonderful world wasn\\'t real.\\nBut that was a year ago. Now I lived in Greece and had a job I enjoyed. And I had a wonderful, kind boss, Stavros. Stavros looks like a big animal and has a black beard. But he\\'s a very good archaeologist. Sometimes I think that he can feel what is under the earth, even before he begins to look for it. And he\\'s very kind. I love\\nworking for him.\\nAfter I left the doctor\\'s I went to see Stavros at the university.\\nStavros is very big man, but his office is so untidy that sometimes it\\'s hard to find him. As usual there were pots and bits of pots all over his desk. Stavros knows almost everything about Greek pots. Every day I spend with him, I learn something. When I walked into his office, he was looking through a magnifying glass. \\'Oh!\\' I said. “You\\'ve got that pot again. That\\'s great.\\' Stavros put down the magnifying glass.\\n\\n\\'Yes,\\' he replied. \\'The police gave the pot to me this morning. Two men were trying to take it out of the country. The police caught them at the airport.\\'\\n\\'That\\'s wonderful,\\' I said. “It\\'s a lovely pot. It belongs here in Greece. In a museum.\\'', \"I have put too much of myself into this painting.\\nThrough the open windows of the room came the rich scent of summer flowers. Lord Henry Wotton lay back in his chair and smoked his cigarette. Beyond the soft sounds of the garden he could just hear the noise of London.\\nIn the centre of the room there was a portrait of a very beautiful young man, and in front of it stood the artist himself, Basil Hallward.\\n'It's your best work, Basil, the best portrait that you've ever painted, said Lord Henry lazily. 'You must send it to the best art gallery in London. 'No, Basil said slowly. 'No, I won't send it anywhere.' Lord Henry was surprised. 'But my dear Basil, why not?' he asked.\\n'What strange people you artists are! You want to be famous, but then you're not happy when you are famous. It's bad when people talk about you - but it's much worse when they don't talk about you!\\nI know you'll laugh at me,' replied Basil, “but I can't exhibit the picture in an art gallery. I've put too much of myself into it? Lord Henry laughed.\\n'Too much of yourself into it! You don't look like him at all. He has a fair and beautiful face. And you - well, you look intelligent, of course, but with your strong face and black hair, you are not beautiful! 'You don't understand me, Harry, replied Basil. (Lord Henry's friends always called him Harry.) 'Of course I'm\\n\\n\\nnot like him, Basil continued. 'In fact, I prefer not to be beautiful.\\n'Dorian Gray's beautiful face will perhaps bring him danger and trouble.' 'Dorian Gray? Is that his name?' asked Lord Henry. 'Yes. But I didn't want to tell you! 'Why not?'\\n'Oh, I can't explain,' said Basil. 'When I like people a lot, I never tell their names to my other friends. I love secrets, that's all.\\nOf course, agreed his friend. 'Life is much more exciting when you have secrets. For example, I never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I'm doing. When we meet-and we do meet sometimes-we tell each other crazy stories, and we pretend that they're true!\\n'You pretend all the time, Harry, said Basil. “I think that you're probably a very good husband, but you like to hide your true feelings?\\n'Oh, don't be so serious, Basil, smiled Lord Henry. 'Let's go into the garden!\\nIn the garden the leaves shone in the sunlight, and the flowers moved gently in the summer wind. The two young men sat on a long seat under the shadow of a tall tree. 'Before I go,' said Lord Henry, 'you must answer my question, Basil. Why won't you exhibit Dorian Gray's\\n\\n\\nportrait in an art gallery?' He looked at his friend and smiled. Please give me the real reason, now. Not the answer that you gave me before!\\n'Harry, when an artist feels strongly about a portrait, it becomes a portrait of himself, not of the sitter. The artist paints the face and body of the sitter, but in fact he shows his own feelings. The reason why I won't exhibit this portrait is because I'm afraid it shows the secret of my heart.' Lord Henry laughed.\", 'The streets of Manhattan were busy, as usual. It was a late afternoon in October. Tall buildings stood outlined against a pale blue sky. On the twentieth floor of one of the tall buildings a man stood by an open window. He\\nlooked down at the streets far below.\\nHe took a deep breath.\\nHe jumped.\\n\\n***\\n\\nTwenty four hours later, Joe Faust sat at a desk in the same building. He was a few floors down from the twentieth floor. His tie was undone and his face was damp with sweat. I\\'ve bought thousands of shares for my clients, he thought, and if that computer screen doesn\\'t show a rise in their price soon I\\'m in big trouble!\\nJoe Faust was a city trader. He bought shares on the internet for his clients for as low a price as possible, then he sold them for as high a price as possible. He was always looking for a profit. Joe and his company got a percentage of the profits he made for his clients. But Joe had spent all the money he had been allowed on the shares he saw on the screen in front of him. He was so confident they would make a profit that he had spent even more than he was allowed Joe knew it was risky. The company didn\\'t like losing money. Not one bit.\\n\\n\\n\"Come on! You just have to come up in price!” he shouted out to the screen. His hand was held over the computer keyboard. He was ready to push the key that would mean the sale of all the shares he had bought. If the\\nshares went down any more in price he could lose his job.\\nAt last they didn\\'t go down any more. But Joe didn\\'t push the key yet. He waited for a few minutes. “Come on!” he shouted. Finally, the shares went up in price. They went up again. And again. And again. Then they stayed still.\\n\"Now!\" Joe pushed down on the key and sold all the thousands of shares he had bought in an instant. \"Yes!” he yelled with delight. “Oh, yes!”\\nJoe was still laughing to himself when the phone rang. It was his boss, Brad Benson. “Joe, I want you in my office, now!\"\\n\"I wonder what that\\'s all about,” Joe thought to himself, as he stood up. He hoped he wasn\\'t in trouble. Even making money could get you into trouble if you didn\\'t play by the rules. Unless, of course, you made enough. Joe fastened his tie and left.\\nA few minutes later Joe Faust was in the office of his boss, Brad Benson. Brad Benson was sitting behind his oak desk. He was about forty years old. Most of the hair on his head was gone though he did have a thick, brown\\n\\n\\nmoustache growing on his upper lip. Joe admired the expensive Italian suit his boss was wearing. He wished he\\'d\\nput on something better than his sports jacket.', \"The air hostess smiled. 'Welcome aboard, sir. Would you like a newspaper?'\\n'Yes, please.' Carl took the newspaper and looked at his ticket. I'm in seat 5F. Where's that?' 'It's near the front of the plane, sir. On the left, there. By the window! 'I see. Thank you very much' Carl smiled back at the air hostess. She was young and pretty. Just like my daughter, he thought.\\nHe put his bag under his seat and sat down. His friend Harald sat beside him. They watched the other passengers coming onto the plane. Harald looked at his watch.\\n9.30 p.m.,' he said. Good. We're on time!\\nCarl agreed. And in three hours we'll be home,' he said. 'That's good. We've been away for a long time. You'll be pleased to see your family, won't you, Harald?'\\nHarald smiled. 'Yes, I will. Have you seen this, sir?' He opened his bag and took out two small planes. 'These are for my sons. I always bring something back for them!\\n'How old are your sons?' Carl asked. 'Five and almost seven. The older one has a birthday tomorrow. 'He'll be very excited tonight then. 'Yes. I hope he gets some sleep.'\\n\\n\\nThe plane took off. Carl watched the lights of the airport grow smaller below them. Then the plane flew above the clouds and he could see the moon and the stars in the night sky. He lay back in his seat and closed his\\neyes.\\nLater, he woke up. Harald was asleep. Carl looked at his watch. It was midnight. He called the air hostess. 'Excuse me. What time do we arrive?' '11.30 p.m. local time, sir. That's about half an hour from now.' 'Thank you.' Carl changed the time on his watch. 'Anything else, sir?' 'No, I don't think so. Oh, wait a minute - could I have a cup of coffee, please?'\\n'Yes, of course, sir? He watched her bring the coffee. 'She walks like my daughter, too, he thought. “And she is very young. She looks nervous, not sure what to do!\\n'How long have you been an air hostess?” he asked. She smiled. 'Three months, sir,' she said. 'Do you like it?' 'Yes, I love it. It's very exciting. She smiled nervously. 'Will that be all, sir?' 'Yes, thank you!\\n\\n\\n'Have a nice flight:\", \"My name is David Copperfield and I was born in the county of Suffolk, in the east of England. This book is the story of my life. Will I be the hero of my own story? You must read it and decide for yourself.\\nI never knew my father. He died before I was born. When this story begins, my mother had been a widow for six months.\\nShe was living in our big old house in a little village called Blunderstone. One afternoon in March, my mother was sitting by the fire, crying quietly to herself. Her baby would be born soon-a baby that would never know its father. My mother felt lonely and sad.\\nThe room was very quiet. Then, suddenly, there was a tapping sound at the window. My mother, who was easily frightened, looked up quickly.\\nThere was an old lady in the garden. She was looking in at the window, with her face pressed against the glass. My mother stood up and her heart began to beat very fast. She was so frightened, that she almost fainted.\\n'Who is it? What do you want?' she whispered.\\nThe old lady, who was tall and thin, tapped on the window again. She was wearing spectacles and her bonnet was very old-fashioned. My mother, who had now recognized the old lady, hurried to open the front door.\\nThe old lady spoke first. 'You must be Clara-Mrs David Copperfield,' she said in a sharp voice. 'I am Miss Trotwood-Miss Betsy\\n\\n\\nTrotwood. We haven't met before. But I'm sure you have heard of me. I am your late husband's aunt'\\n'Yes, yes, of course,' my mother replied. Please come in.' Miss Betsy Trotwood followed my mother into the sitting room and sat down by the fire.\\n'Your husband told you about me, didn't he?' the old lady asked.\\nMy mother nodded. 'Yes, he did, she said. “My dear husband-your nephew-often talked about his Aunt Betsy. He spoke of you just before he died. My poor mother began to cry again.\\n'Well, here I am, Miss Betsy said. “Sit down, child. Let me look at you.' My mother was very pretty, with a sweet, pale face and long, fair curls.\\nAunt Betsy shook her head sadly and gently touched my mother's pretty hair. When are you expecting your child?' the old lady asked. “You are not much more than a baby yourself.' My mother began to cry more than ever.\\nVery soon,' she said. 'I am so frightened. I am afraid that I shall die and my baby too!' 'Nonsense,' Miss Betsy said. “You won't die and neither will your little girl!\\n'The baby may be a boy, my mother said quietly.\\n'I don't think so,' Miss Betsy replied. I'm sure that the baby will be a girl. Her name will be Betsy Trotwood Copperfield. I will help you look after her, I will teach her to think for herself!' 'Thank you,' my mother whispered.\", \"'Now, Emil,' said his mother, 'get ready your clothes are on your bed. Get dressed, and then we'll have our dinner!\\nYes, Mother!\\n'Wait a minute. Have I forgotten anything? Your other clothes are in your case. There's some food for your journey. These flowers are for your aunt. I'll give you the money for your grandmother after dinner. No, that's all, I\\nthink.'\\nEmil left the room and Mrs Fisher turned to her neighbour, Mrs Martin. “My son's going to the city for two or\\nthree weeks. At first he didn't want to go. But what can he do here while his school's closed? My sister's asked us\\nagain and again to visit her. I can't go, because I have so much work. Emil's never travelled alone before, but he's old enough now. He'll be all right: his grandmother's going to meet him at the station!\\n'I think he'll enjoy the city,' said Mrs Martin. 'All boys like it. There are so many things to see. I must go now, Mrs Fisher. Goodbye!\\nEmil came back into the room and sat down at the table. His hair was tidy and he was wearing his best jacket. While he ate, he watched his mother. 'I mustn't eat too much,' he thought. 'She won't like it when I'm going away for the first time.'\\nBut his mother was thinking about other things. 'Don't forget to write to me when you arrive,' she said. 'All right!\\n\\n\\n'Give my love to your aunt and your grandmother and your cousin Polly. Look after yourself. And be good. I don't want anyone to say that you're not a polite boy!\\n'I promise.\\nAfter dinner Emil's mother went to the sitting-room. There was a tin box on one of the shelves. She took out\\nsome money and came back to the table.\\n'Here's seventy pounds,' she said. 'Five ten-pound notes and four five-pound notes. Give your grandmother sixty pounds. I couldn't send the money to her before. But I've worked hard and I've saved it for her. The other ten pounds is for you. Your return journey will cost about three pounds. Use the other seven pounds when you go out. I'll put the money in this little bag. Now don't lose it! Where will you put it?'\\nEmil thought for a minute, then he put the bag into the pocket inside his jacket. It'll be safe there,' he said. His mother looked serious. 'You mustn't tell anyone on the train about the money! 'Of course not,' said Emil.\\nSome people think that seventy pounds is not a large amount of money. But it was a lot of money to Emil and his mother. Emil's father was dead, so his mother worked hard all day. She paid for their food and clothes, and for her son's books and his school. Emil realized that his mother worked hard. So he really tried to do well in class. She\\n\\n\\nwas always pleased when he got a good report from his teacher at the end of the year.\\n'Let's go now,' said Mrs Fisher. 'You mustn't miss the train. If the bus comes along, we'll take it.'\", 'John and Tyler are in the park. They are showing everybody their cars and planes. “These are really great!” says Tyler. John talks to his friends Faye and David. \"Faye and David, do you want to try?\" asks John. Faye says, “No thanks, we\\'re going to the beach.\" “Do you want to come?\" asks David.\\n“No thanks, David,” John says. “Have a good time at the beach.” “Okay, see you later,” say David and Faye. David says, “It\\'s a great day to swim. Come on, Faye.” “Yes, let\\'s go,” replies Faye. John and Tyler play with their cars and planes in the park.\\nDavid and Faye go down to the beach. They see their friend Daniela. “Hi, Daniela, it\\'s hot today!” says Faye. “Hi. Yeah. Do you want ice cream?” Daniela asks. Faye says, “Yes, please.” David gives her the money.\\n\\n\\n“We\\'re going swimming,” says Faye. “Okay, have a good time. See you later,\" says Daniela.\\nFaye and David walk down onto the beach. They are going swimming.\\nThere are many people on the beach. Some people are walking on the beach. Dogs are playing on the beach, too. Everybody is having a great time.\\nFaye and David put their things on the beach. They are getting ready to swim. They see a man running on the beach. “David, what\\'s that man doing?\" asks Faye. “I don\\'t know,\" replies David. “I don\\'t know.” “He\\'s running very fast,\" says Faye.\\nThe man has a bag. “Stop! Stop!” shouts a woman. “Stop him! He has my bag.\" Faye says, “That man has the woman\\'s bag!”\\n\\n\\n“Quick, let\\'s stop him,\" says David. “But how? Think. Quick, David, think!\" says Faye.\\nThe man is running away.\\n\"Where\\'s he going?\" asks David, “He\\'s going to the street, I think,” Faye says. Faye gets her phone. She calls Daniela. “Daniela, it\\'s Faye. Stop that man, Daniela,” she says. “Okay, but which man?\" asks Daniela. “The man in gray. He has a woman\\'s bag. He\\'s coming to you,” says Faye. “Okay, I can see him,” says Daniela. “I\\'ll stop him,\" she says.\\nDaniela pushes the cart into the man. The man falls down. He drops the woman\\'s bag. Daniela tries to stop the man, but she can\\'t. The man is very big and he\\'s too strong. Daniela can\\'t stop him. The man gets up and takes the woman\\'s bag. He runs away to the park.\\n\\n\\nFaye and David run to Daniela. “Are you okay, Daniela?\" they ask. “Yes, I\\'m okay,\" she says. “I\\'m sorry, he\\'s running away. He\\'s going into the park.” Daniela says, “Let\\'s stop him.” “But how?\" asks Faye. \"What can we do, David?\" she asks. “Do you have an idea?\"\\nDavid calls Tyler. “Tyler, it\\'s David,\" he says. “Can you see a man running into the park?\" Tyler asks, “Yes. Does he have gray pants and a gray shirt?\" “Yes,\" says David. “Stop him! He has a woman\\'s bag.\" “Okay, we\\'ll stop him. But how?\" asks Tyler. “He\\'s a big man. I can\\'t stop him.” “Think!” says David.\\n', \"'Why can't you eat more politely, Jane? Like your sister Ruth!' said Bee across the lunch table.\\n'She's better at spaghetti than I am, that's all,' said Jane. 'I can't be bothered with things like that.' Her Aunt Bee looked along the table at the twins Jane and Ruth, and smiled. They were almost ten, and were exactly the same, but it was never difficult to tell which was Jane and which was Ruth. Jane always seemed to wear old clothes, clothes for riding horses and for working with them. Ruth, on the other hand, was always in a fresh, clean dress, her hands were never dirty and her hair was always neat and tidy.\\nEight years, thought Bee. Eight years since the sudden, shocking death of the twins' mother and father, Nora and Bill, in that terrible plane crash! Eight years since she left her life and her job in London to come to Latchetts in order to look after her dead brother's children. And soon she would no longer be responsible for them. The twins' brother, Simon, would be twenty-one in a few weeks' time, and his mother's fortune would be his. The father had not been poor; the Ashby family had lived comfortably at Latchetts for more than two hundred years, but they had never been rich. Latchetts was a small estate of three farms, the park and the house itself. Bill's death had left his sister Bee with many problems as well as those of bringing up his children. Bee had refused to use the money that had belonged to Bill's wife, and had been determined to manage the estate as a successful business. The money would go to the oldest son when he was twenty-one and Bee had decided not to touch it. So Latchetts had earned its living as a farm for horses, as a school for training horses, as a school for people who wanted to learn to ride,\\n\\n\\nand each year Latchetts had made a profit. Bee had made sure of that.\\nAnd in six weeks' time Simon would be twenty-one, would receive his mother's money, and become master\\nof Latchetts.\\nWhat would he do with it, wondered Bee, as she watched his fair head across the lunch table.\\nSimon, who had so much charm, but who was also so selfish. He seemed so often to want help, but always with such a charming manner that people helped him, even before he asked. In fact, it wasn't true that he was helpless; it was just his way of making sure that he could get what he wanted. Unfortunately, very few people, except Bee, seemed to understand this side of Simon's character.\\nThe twins' older sister, Eleanor, came in. 'Oh, you smell of horses,' said Ruth, turning up her nose. 'What made you so late, Eleanor?' asked Bee. 'Oh, the Parslow girl from Clare. But it's a waste of time trying to teach her. She'll never learn to ride! 'Perhaps mad people can't ride,' suggested Ruth. 'Ruth!' said Bee firmly. “The pupils at the school at Clare are not crazy. They're just ... difficult. 'Well, they seem to be mad, from what I see of them, answered Ruth. Silence fell on the Ashby table. Bee thought about Latchetts, the estate that would belong to Simon in a few\\n\\n\\nweeks. She hoped he would look after it well. It was the only local estate to have stayed in the same family for over two hundred years.\\nEven the big estate at Clare, with its beautiful, long, white house had been sold. The Ledingham family had wasted their money and had not looked after their land. In the end they had had to sell the house where they had lived for so long, but which had perhaps never really been a home for them. The house at Clare had become a school for difficult children with rich parents, and the Ledinghams had gone.\\nBut the Ashbys stayed at Latchetts.\", 'Brig Laurel, River St. Laurence,\\nAugust 6, 1832.\\nI left off writing, my dear mother, from this simple cause, I had nothing to say. One day was but the echo, as it were, of the one that preceded it; so that a page copied from the mate\\'s log would have proved as amusing, and\\nto the full as instructive, as my journal, provided I had kept one during the last fortnight.\\nSo barren of events has that time been that the sight of a party of bottlenosed whales, two or three seals, and a porpoise, possibly on their way to a dinner or tea party at the North Pole, was considered an occurrence of great importance. Every glass was in requisition as soon as they made their appearance, and the marine monsters were well nigh stared out of countenance. We came within sight of the shores of Newfoundland on the 5th of August, just one month from the day we took our last look of the British Isles. Yet though the coast was brown, and rugged, and desolate, I hailed its appearance with rapture. Never did anything seem so refreshing and delicious to me as the land breeze that came to us, as I thought, bearing health and gladness on its wings.\\nI had noticed with some curiosity the restless activity of the captain\\'s bird some hours previous to \"land\" being proclaimed from the look-out station. He sang continually, and his note was longer, clearer, and more\\nthrilling than heretofore; the little creature, the captain assured me, was conscious of the difference in the air as\\nwe approached the land. “I trust almost as much to my bird as to my glass,” he said, \"and have never yet been\\n\\n\\ndeceived.\"\\nOur progress was somewhat tedious after we entered the gulf. Ninety miles across is the entrance of this\\nmajestic river; it seems an ocean in itself. Half our time is spent poring over the great chart in the cabin, which\\nis constantly being rolled and unrolled by my husband to gratify my desire of learning the names of the distant shores and islands which we pass. We are without a pilot as yet, and the captain being a cautious seaman is unwilling to risk the vessel on this dangerous navigation; so that we proceed but slowly on our voyage.\\nAugust 7.-We were visited this morning by a beautiful little bird, not much larger than our goldcrested wren. I hailed it as a bird of good omen-a little messenger sent to bid us welcome to the New World, and I felt almost a childish joy at the sight of our little visitor. There are happy moments in our lives when we draw the greatest pleasure from the most trifling sources, as children are pleased with the most simple toy. From the hour we entered the gulf a perceptible change had taken place in all on board. The captain, a man of grave, quiet manners, grew quite talkative. My husband was more than usually animated, and even the thoughtful young Scotchman became positively an entertaining person. The crew displayed the most lively zeal in the performance of their duty, and the goldfinch sung cheerily from dawn till sunset. As for me, Hope was busy in my heart, chasing from it all feelings of doubt or regret that might sadden the present or cloud the future.\\n\\n\\nI am now able to trace distinctly the outline of the coast on the southern side of the river. Sometimes the high lands are suddenly enveloped in dense clouds of mist, which are in constant motion, rolling along in shadowy billows, now tinted with rosy light, now white and fleecy, or bright as silver, as they catch the sunbeams. So rapid are the changes that take place in this fog-bank, that perhaps the next time I raise my eyes I behold the scene changed as if by magic. The misty curtain is slowly drawn up, as if by invisible hands, and the wild, wooded mountains partially revealed, with their bold rocky shores and sweeping bays. At other times the vapoury volume dividing, moves along the valleys and deep ravines like lofty pillars of smoke, or hangs in snowy draperies among the dark forest pines.\\nTam never weary of watching these fantastic clouds; they recall to me the pleasant time I spent in the Highlands, among the cloud-capped hills of the north.\\nAs yet, the air is cold, and we experience frequent squalls of wind and hail, with occasional peals of thunder; then again all is serene and bright, and the air is filled with fragrance, and flies, and bees, and birds come flitting past us from the shore.', 'UPON the moonlit stillness came suddenly a far-off, muffled, crashing sound. Just once it came, then once again the stillness of the wilderness night, the stillness of vast, untraversed solitude. The Boy lifted his eyes and glanced across the thin reek of the camp-fire at Jabe Smith, who sat smoking contemplatively. Answering the glance, the woodsman muttered “old tree fallin\\',\" and resumed his passive contemplation of the sticks glowing keenly in the fire. The Boy, upon whom, as soon as he entered the wilderness, the taciturnity of the woodsfolk descended as a garment, said nothing, but scanned his companion\\'s gaunt face with a gravely incredulous smile.\\nSo wide-spread and supreme was the silence that five seconds after that single strange sound had died out it seemed, somehow, impossible to believe it had ever been. The light gurgle of the shallow and shrunken brook which ran past the open front of the travellers\\' “lean-to” served only to measure the stillness. Both Jabe and the Boy, since eating their dinner, had gradually forgotten to talk. As the moon rose over the low, fir-crested hills they had sunk into reverie, watching the camp-fire die down.\\nAt last, with a sort of crisp whisper a stick, burnt through the middle, fell apart, and a flicker of red flame leaped up. The woodsman knocked out his pipe, rose slowly to his feet, stretched his gaunt length, and murmured, “Reckon we might as well turn in.”\\n“That\\'s all right for you, Jabe,\" answered the Boy, rising also, tightening his belt, and reaching for his rifle, “but I\\'m going off to see what I can see. Night\\'s the time to see things in the woods.”\\n\\n\\nJabe grunted non-committally, and began spreading his blanket in the lean-to. “Don\\'t forgit to come back for breakfast, that\\'s all,” he muttered. He regarded the Boy as a phenomenally brilliant hunter and trapper spoiled by\\nsentimental notions.\\nTo the Boy, whose interest in all pertaining to woodcraft was much broader and more sympathetic than that\\nof his companion, Jabe\\'s interpretation of the sound of the falling tree had seemed hasty and shallow. He knew\\nthat there was no better all-round woodsman in these countries than Jabe Smith; but he knew also that Jabe\\'s\\ninterest in the craft was limited pretty strictly to his activities as hunter, trapper and lumberman. Just now he was\\nall lumberman. He was acting as what is called a \"timber-cruiser,\" roaming the remoter and less-known regions of the wilderness to locate the best growths of spruce and pine for the winter\\'s lumbering operations, and for the present his keen faculties were set on the noting of tree growths, and water-courses, and the lay of the land for the getting out of a winter\\'s cutting. On this particular cruise the Boy—who, for all the disparity in their years and the divergence in their views, was his most valued comrade—had accompanied him with a special object in view. The region they were cruising was one which had never been adequately explored, and it was said to be full of little unnamed, unmapped lakes and streams, where, in former days, the Indians had had great beaver hunting.\\nWhen the sound of the falling tree came to his ears across the night-silence, the Boy at once said to himself, “Beavers, at work!” He said it to himself, not aloud, because he knew that Jabe also, as a trapper, would be\\n\\n\\ninterested in beavers; and he had it in his mind to score a point on Jabe. Noiseless as a lynx in his soft-soled \"Iarrigans,\" he ascended the half-empty channel of the brook, which here strained its shrunken current through\\nrocks and slate-slabs, between steep banks. The channel curved steadily, rounding the shoulder of a low ridge.\\nWhen he felt that he had travelled somewhat less than half a mile, he came out upon a bit of swampy marsh,\\nbeyond which, over the crest of a low dam, spread the waters of a tranquil pond shining like a mirror in the moonlight.\\nThe Boy stopped short, his heart thumping with excitement and anticipation. Here before him was what he\\nhad come so far to find. From his books and from his innumerable talks with hunter and trapper, he knew that the dam and the shining, lonely pond were the work of beavers. Presently he distinguished amid the sheen of the water a tiny, grassy islet, with a low, dome-shaped, stick-covered mound at one end of it. This, plainly, was a beaver house, the first he had ever seen. His delighted eyes, observing it at this distance, at once pronounced it immeasurably superior to the finest and most pretentious muskrat-house he had ever seen a very palace, indeed, by comparison. Then, a little further up the pond, and apparently adjoining the shore, he made out another dome-shaped structure, broader and less conspicuous than the first, and more like a mere pile of sticks. The pond, which was several acres in extent, seemed to him an extremely spacious domain for the dwellers in these two houses.\\n\\n\\nPresently he marked a black trail, as it were, moving down in the middle of the radiance from the upper end of the pond. It was obviously the trail of some swimmer, but much too broad, it seemed, to be made by anything so small as a beaver. It puzzled him greatly. In his eagerness he pushed noiselessly forward, seeking a better view, till he was within some thirty feet of the dam. Then he made out a small dark spot in the front of the trail, - evidently a beaver\\'s head; and at last he detected that the little swimmer was carrying a bushy branch, one end held in his mouth while the rest was slung back diagonally across his shoulders.\\n', \"OK, that's it for today' says Mr. Babic. 'Read some more of your book for the next class.'\\nThe students put their books in their bags and start to go out of the classroom. Samorn doesn't get up. She puts her head on the table. This is very difficult, she thinks. She loves Economics, but here in the U.S. she has to study it in English. She isn't studying in Thai, her language. It's difficult to understand everything. She looks at the other students in the class. They look happy. They're happy because they understand, she thinks.\\nSamorn closes her eyes and starts to think about home. She thinks about Thailand where she lives. She thinks\\nabout the hot weather, about the nice food and about her friends. She remembers her mother and father, her\\nsisters and brothers. She thinks about her boyfriend Lek and she wants to cry. Why am I here? she thinks. This is only her first week at Brenton College, but she wants to go home.\\nSamorn looks at her watch. It's just after eleven o'clock. In Thailand it's one o'clock in the morning.\\nShe goes out of the classroom and she walks to her room in the dorm. It's nice, but cold. It's September and the trees are orange and brown. She sees students everywhere, in twos and threes. They're laughing and talking as they walk to and from their classes. They all look happy.\\n'Hi!' Samorn hears someone speaking and she looks. She sees a student from her class. Harrison, his name is,\\nshe thinks.\\n'Hello,' Samorn replies. She smiles a little, but she doesn't look into Harrison's eyes.\\n\\n\\nHarrison is with some friends. They're all laughing at Harrison. Harrison is funny and he says funny things. She sees that in class. He's good-looking too and he looks rich. He wears good clothes. He comes from a very rich family, she knows. Samorn's family has money too - her mother and father are lawyers in Bangkok - but it's not the same. She's different, from him, from all of them. She walks to her dorm room at Evelyn Royce House. She looks at her room and thinks Is this really my home for the next four years?\", '“Are you ready, Tyler?\" asks his friend, Eric. \"Yes, I\\'m ready,\" Tyler replies.\\nToday is a big day in Bayview. There is a big bike race today. Everybody is very excited. Ryan is in the race, too. Tyler and Ryan are both very good riders. They both want to win the race.\\nTyler\\'s friends John and Eric want him to win.\\n\"Have a good race, Tyler,\" says Eric. “Thanks, I want to win this year,” says Tyler. John says, “Ryan wins every year. But I think you\\'ll win today.” “Be careful of Ryan. He\\'s very fast,\" says Eric. “I know,\" Tyler replies. “I\\'ll watch him.”\\nRyan is with his father, Mr. Walsh. Ryan has a new bike. Every year Ryan\\'s father buys him a new bike for this race. It is a very good bike. It is very fast. He is very happy. “I\\'ll win this race again this year, too, with my new bike,” Ryan thinks.\\n\\n\\nRyan\\'s father is talking to Ryan. “I want you to win. Our family always finishes first,” Mr. Walsh says. “We always win. Do you understand?\" “Yes, dad,\" says Ryan. “I understand. Our family always wins.” His father says, “I want you to go faster than last year, okay? You will win today. Okay?\" Ryan is worried but he says, “Yes, dad.”\\nTyler, Ryan, and the other riders go to the starting line. Ryan is worried about the race. He looks at his father.\\nHis father really wants Ryan to win.\\nRyan looks at Tyler. He knows Tyler wants to win, too. “I\\'ll win today. I\\'m Ryan Walsh! I always win,” Ryan thinks. “I have a good bike and I\\'m a good rider. I\\'m very good,” he thinks.\\nTyler looks at Ryan\\'s new bike. “Is that a new bike, Ryan?” he asks. “Yes,\" Ryan says. “Do you like it?\" Tyler says, “You have a good bike, but I\\'m going to win. Let\\'s have a good race.” “Yeah,” Ryan replies. “I\\'ll see you at the finishing line.”\\n\\n\\nTyler and Ryan start very fast. They are winning. They are faster than the other riders. They go faster and\\nfaster.\\nTyler and Ryan race around a corner. \"Good, I\\'m winning,” thinks Tyler. Ryan is second but he is going fast, too.\\nThey go up and down. They go through the trees. They go through a river. It is a very good race. Tyler is going fast and Ryan is going fast, too. Now Ryan is winning. And Tyler is second.\\nThey race through some more trees. Tyler and Ryan are tired, but they both want to win today. “I always win!\" thinks Ryan. “I can\\'t be second! I won\\'t be second!” “I\\'ll win today!” thinks Tyler. They go faster and faster. It is a great race.\\n\\n\\nThey see a gate. They race to it. The first person to the gate will win the race. The two bikes are very close. Ryan goes faster, but Tyler is winning. \"I want to be first to the gate,\" thinks Ryan. “I want to win! I always win!\"\\n', \"If you know Starkfield, Massachusetts, you know the post office there. If you know the post office, you have probably seen Ethan Frome driving up to it in his buggy; and you have probably wondered who he was.\\nIt was there that, several years ago, I saw him for the first time. He was a noticeable figure. His tall, strong body was badly twisted, and much shorter on the right side than on the left. He moved slowly and painfully, pulling himself along. Just the few steps from his buggy to the post office were clearly difficult for him. His face had a sad, grim look. It was the face and body of an old man, and I was surprised to hear that he was only Fifty\\ntwo.\\nI learnt this from Harmon Gow, a man who knew all the families around Starkfield.\\n'He's been like that since his bad accident, nearly twenty-four years ago,' said Harmon. 'But Fromes don't die young. Ethan'll live to a hundred, probably! 'He looks like a dead man already,' I said. 'I guess he's been in Starkfield too many winters,' said Harmon. 'Most smart people get out of here.' 'Why didn't he get out?' | asked. 'He had to stay and take care of his family. First his father got hurt, then his mother fell sick, then his wife! 'And then the accident?'\\n\\n\\nHarmon gave a little smile.\\n'That's right. He had to stay then. Ethan Frome used to drive in from his farm every day at about midday, and because I picked up my mail at about the same time, I often saw him. He came to the post office only for a newspaper, and sometimes for a packet from a medicine company for Mrs Zeena Frome!\\nStarkfield people understood that he did not want to stop and talk, and on most days Frome climbed slowly back into his buggy and drove away without a word to anyone.\\nAt that time my company had sent me on an engineering job near Starkfield, and I was staying at the home of a lady called Mrs Ruth Hale. Before she was married, her name had been Ruth Varnum, but her husband Ned Hale\\nwas now dead, and she had returned to live with her mother in the Varnum home. It was a grand house, large and white, with tall dark trees outside. Although it was clear that the Varnums no longer had much money, theirs was still the finest house in the village.\\nRuth Hale enjoyed talking about her neighbours, and I hoped that she could tell me more about Ethan Frome. But when I asked her, she just looked unhappy and said in a low voice:\\n'Yes, I knew them both ... it was awful...\\nI asked other people, and everybody in Starkfield agreed that Ethan Frome had had more troubles in his life than most people. But nobody explained why he had that sad, grim look on his face.\\n\\n\\nIn the end, I learnt the story, piece by piece, from several people. As often happens, the story was different each time, but I slowly began to put it together. And my interest in Ethan Frome grew stronger when a little later | met the man himself.\\nIt happened like this. Every day I had to travel about three miles to the station, where I got my train to work. I usually hired a horse from Denis Eady, the rich village shopkeeper. But in the middle of winter his and most of the other Starkfield horses caught an illness. For a day or two I could not find a horse to hire anywhere, until Harmon Gow had an idea.\\nWhy don't you ask Ethan Frome to drive you?' he said.\\n'His horse ain't sick, and he needs a dollar or two. That Frome farm and saw-mill don't make enough money to keep a cat alive.' So Ethan Frome agreed to drive me, and every day for a week I sat beside him in his sleigh as his thin horse pulled us over the hard snow to the station. Then, in the icy evenings, he brought me back to\\nStarkfield.\\n\", '\\n“Take this money, Yoon-Hee,\" says Mrs. Lee. “Please go to the store with Ji-Sung.\"\\nYoon-Hee and Ji-Sung are brother and sister.\\nBut Ji-Sung says, “I don\\'t want to do the shopping.” “Oh, come on, Ji-Sung,\" says Yoon-Hee. “Let\\'s help Mom.”\\nYoon-Hee and Ji-Sung go out of the house.

Sea birds played near our big boat and the small boats near us on the sea.\\nI started to look at the people with us on our boat. They all watched the sea birds and talked and laughed. They were all happy on the first day of their holiday too. And suddenly there he was, this tall, quiet boy in a blue and white shirt: he was really good looking. I'll always remember the first time I saw him.\\nHe didn't see me then. He was with some friends. One of the boys was his brother, I think: they had the same blue eyes, the same mouth and nose, nearly the same hair. His brother and one of the boys with him tried to catch the sea birds and he smiled at them. Then they came and stood near us, and they talked about the small boats on the sea. I watched him over Louise's head all the time!\\nHis brother and his friend made a lot of noise, but he was quiet and didn't talk a lot. Then suddenly he looked at me and his eyes stayed on me, and he smiled his lovely smile with his shy blue eyes.\\nThe people near me on the boat, the sun, the sea and the birds, the noise of all his friends, time - it all stopped. At that moment there was only him and me, me and him. Him and his smile for me. Only the two of us.\\nSlowly, very slowly, the boat started to move away, across the water to Spain.

Run, Jenny!” he says. Mr. Jenkins says, “Stop! No, don\\'t run! Wait there.\"', \"In the early years of the nineteenth century, strange-looking little men were often seen on the country roads, usually with a heavy bag on their shoulders.\\nThey were linen-weavers, taking the linen they had woven to the women in the villages. Unlike the strong, healthy country people, they were small and thin, with tired white faces, bent backs and\\nround shoulders.\\nThey were often shortsighted too, because they had to look so closely at their work. To the villagers the weavers looked almost foreign, and quite frightening.\\nWhere did they come from? Was it the devil who sent them? Who were their parents? How could you trust a man if you didn't know his father or mother? Country people used to be very suspicious of all strangers and travellers.\\nThey were also suspicious of clever people, people who could do something they themselves had not learnt to do.\\nThat is why the linen-weavers, who often moved from towns to live and work in the country, were considered strangers all their lives by their neighbours, and were sometimes very lonely as a result.\\nSilas Marner was one of these weavers. He lived in a small cottage near the village of Raveloe.\\n\\n\\nEvery day he worked at his loom in the cottage.\\nThe small boys of Raveloe had never heard the sound of a loom before, and sometimes they used to run up to his house to look quickly in at the window.\\nIf Silas noticed them, he lifted his shortsighted eyes from the loom to stare at the boys. There was something terrible about his stare, which made the boys run away at once, screaming with fear.\\nThe villagers believed that Silas had an almost devilish power, which he could use to harm them if he wanted, and so they were all afraid of him.\\nRaveloe was an important-looking village with a fine old church and a number of large farms.\\nBut it was at least an hour away from any other village, and very few strangers visited it, which explains why the villagers' opinions were so out of date.\\nSilas Marner had first come to Raveloe fifteen years before, as a young man. He and his way of life seemed very strange to the villagers. He worked long hours at his loom, and had no friends or visitors from the village or anywhere else.\\nHe never talked to his neighbours unless it was necessary for his work, and he never looked at any of the Raveloe girls. 'Who would want to marry him anyway?' the girls laughed to each other.\\n\\n\\nMarry a dead man come to life again, with that unhealthy white skin and those insect-like eyes of his? Certainly not! One of the villagers had had a strange experience with Silas.\\nOne evening he had discovered the weaver resting on a field gate, his eyes open but unseeing, and his body\\nAfter a few moments Silas appeared to wake up, said Goodnight', and walked away. When this was discussed in the village, some people thought that Silas had had a fit. But others, like Mr Macey, the church clerk, refused to accept a medical explanation. 'No, he isn't ill, that weaver, said old Mr Macey, shaking his head knowingly.\\nIf he had a fit, he'd fall down, wouldn't he? I think his soul flies out of his body sometimes and that's why he looks so strange!\\n'He doesn't come to church, does he? And how does he know so much about medicines? You all remember how he made Sally Oates better, when the doctor himself could do no more for her!\\n'That's the devil's work, believe me!' However, the housewives needed Silas to weave their linen, and they could find nothing wrong with his work.\\nThe years passed, and Raveloe villagers did not change their opinion of the weaver.\", '\"Yes!\" called Estela as she came off the field. \"Good win, everybody.” The soccer game was finished and captain\\nEstela Ramos and her team were the winners.\\n\"Great game!\" she said to the young women in the team. They were tired, but very happy. Estela was the captain of the team, and a very good player. “You were very good!” she said.\\n\"You too, Estela!” said her friend Katy.\\n“Ah, I was OK,” she said. It wasn\\'t her best game ever, she knew, but the team won so she wasn\\'t worried about that.\\nEstela smiled at her friend. Then she walked to Coach George Gray. “So, how was that?\" she asked, smiling. “Hmm. Not bad,\" said the coach. They walked back to the locker rooms.\\n“Not bad?\" said Estela. “We just won the cup! Did you see it?” The coach was never happy, she thought. It was a great win against Tacoma College, a very good team. “The girls worked really well together,” she said, a little angry. “We did OK, didn\\'t we?\"\\n\"Well,” he said. “The team won, yes, but you didn\\'t play well, Estela. You missed a lot of opportunities. And your passing - we must work on your passing. I need more from you ...\" Coach Gray went on for some minutes. “Didn\\'t I do anything right?\" she asked when he finished. Her face was red now. She knew he was right, and\\n\\n\\nthat made it even worse.\\nThe coach didn\\'t speak. He seemed to be thinking about that. \"Aghh!\" she said. She ran away from Coach Gray and into the locker room.\\n*********\\nIn the locker room, Estela was really angry. We won, she thought. Why can\\'t he say something nice? The other girls were happy, and Estela tried to look happy, too. She tried to forget about the coach. “We\\'re going to eat at Ben\\'s, Estela,\" said Katy. “Coming?\" “No,\" she said, “not now. Maybe I\\'ll come later.\" “OK,\" said Katy. Then she and the other girls went to the café. Five minutes later, Estela came out of the locker room. She didn\\'t want to see Coach Gray again.\\nGray wasn\\'t there, but when she came out of the door of the locker room, Estela saw a man of about thirty years old with black hair. He wore a very smart dark blue suit and tie. The suit looked expensive, she thought. He\\nwas very good-looking.', '“More cups, Janine!\" shouted Gayle King.\\nNot again, thought Janine Cole. It was near the end of a busy lunchtime in the college canteen and Janine felt\\ntired. Janine\\'s manager, Gayle King, made her tired - she was always shouting.\\nJanine walked to the table near the window. As she walked across the room she looked at the clock on the wall. Two thirty. It was almost time to pick up Amber. Her little three-year-old girl was with the childminder. It cost money, but it was the only way that Janine could work. She walked quicker.\\nShe got to the table and started to put the dirty cups and plates onto her tray. So many plates, she thought. Why couldn\\'t students put their things away? There was food on the blue table top. I\\'m here to clean up after them, she thought, so they don\\'t care. They don\\'t know how lucky they are. She cleaned the table and picked up the tray. It was heavy, but she started to walk back to the kitchen. Suddenly, she felt someone run into her. Her tray of cups and plates fell to the floor with a loud crrrash! Everyone in the room looked up.\\n“Hey!” Janine shouted. It was a big, tall young man with blond hair. \"Sorry,\" he said.\\n“Sorry? What\\'re you doing running around in here? This is a canteen, not a football field!” Janine was shouting and her face was red. Everyone was looking at her, but she couldn\\'t stop herself. “You think you can just\\n\\n\\nrun around everywhere, and other people have to clean up after you?\"\\n“I\\'m really sorry,\" the young man said quietly. He started to pick things up and put them on the tray. Gayle King arrived. “I\\'m sorry about this,\" she said to the young man. \"Please don\\'t do that. We can do it.\"\\nJanine looked at the young man cleaning the mess up. She wanted to cry. But she didn\\'t cry. She started to help him.\\n“Really, it\\'s no problem,\" the young man said. “It was me, anyway.”\\n\"Joe, clean this up,” Gayle King called to one of the kitchen workers. Then, quietly, she said to Janine, “In my office. Now!\"', 'THE dreadful cholera was depopulating Quebec and Montreal, when our ship cast anchor off Grosse Isle, on the 30th of August, 1832, and we were boarded a few minutes after by the health-officers. One of these\\ngentlemen-a little, shrivelled-up Frenchman-from his solemn aspect and attenuated figure, would have made\\nno bad representative of him who sat upon the pale horse. He was the only grave Frenchman I had ever seen, and I naturally enough regarded him as a phenomenon. His companion-a fine-looking fair-haired Scotchman-though a little consequential in his manners, looked like one who in his own person could combat and vanquish all the evils which flesh is heir to. Such was the contrast between these doctors, that they would have formed very good emblems-one, of vigorous health; the other, of hopeless decay.\\nOur captain, a rude, blunt north-country sailor, possessing certainly not more politeness than might be expected in a bear, received his sprucely dressed visitors on the deck, and, with very little courtesy, abruptly bade them follow him down into the cabin.\\nThe officials were no sooner seated, than glancing hastily round the place, they commenced the following dialogue:\\n\"From what port, captain?\"\\nNow, the captain had a peculiar language of his own, from which he commonly expunged all the connecting links. Small words, such as \"and\" and \"the,\" he contrived to dispense with altogether.\\n\\n\\n\"Scotland-sailed from port o\\' Leith, bound for Quebec, Montreal-general cargo-seventy-two steerage, four cabin passengers-brig, ninety-two tons burden, crew eight hands.\" Here he produced his credentials, and handed them to the strangers. The Scotchman just glanced over the documents, and laid them on the table.\\n\"Had you a good passage out?\"\\n\"Tedious, baffling winds, heavy fogs, detained three weeks on Banks-foul weather making Gulf-short of water, people out of provisions, steerage passengers starving.\"\\n\"Any case of sickness or death on board ?\" \"All sound as crickets.\" \"Any births?\" lisped the little Frenchman.\\nThe captain screwed up his mouth, and after a moment\\'s reflection he replied, \"Births? Why, yes; now I think on\\'t, gentlemen, we had one female on board, who produced three at a birth.\"\\n\"That\\'s uncommon,\" said the Scotch doctor, with an air of lively curiosity. \"Are the children alive and well? I should like much to see them.\" He started up, and knocked his head, for he was very tall, against the ceiling. \"Confound your low cribs ! I have nearly dashed out my brains.\"\\n\"A hard task, that,\" looked the captain to me. He did not speak, but I knew by his sarcastic grin what was uppermost in his thoughts. \"The young ones all males—fine thriving fellows. Step upon deck, Sam Frazer,\" turning\\n\\n\\nto his steward; \"bring them down for doctors to see.\" Sam vanished, with a knowing wink to his superior, and quickly returned, bearing in his arms three fat, chuckle-headed bull-terriers; the sagacious mother following close at his heels, and looked ready to give and take offence on the slightest provocation.\\n\"Here, gentlemen, are the babies,\" said Frazer, depositing his burden on the floor. \"They do credit to the nursing of the brindled slut.\"\\nThe old tar laughed, chuckled, and rubbed his hands in an ecstacy of delight at the indignation and\\ndisappointment visible in the countenance of the Scotch Esculapius, who, angry as he was, wisely held his tongue.\\nNot so the Frenchman; his rage scarcely knew bounds; he danced in a state of most ludicrous excitement; he shook his fist at our rough captain, and screamed at the top of his voice,\\n\"Sacré, you bête ! You tink us dog, ven you try to pass your puppies on us for babies?\" \"Hout, man, don\\'t be angry,\" said the Scotchman, stifling a laugh; \"you see \\'tis only a joke!\"\\n\"Joke! me no understand such joke. Bête!\" returned the angry Frenchman, bestowing a savage kick on one of the unoffending pups which was frisking about his feet. The pup yelped; the slut barked and leaped furiously at the offender, and was only kept from biting him by Sam, who could scarcely hold her back for laughing; the captain was uproarious; the offended Frenchman alone maintained a severe and dignified aspect. The dogs were at length dismissed, and peace restored.', \"It had been a long day. It was almost time for a cold beer.\\nStella was reading at her desk. How are things, Stella?' I asked. ‘Everything's fine except that the office is too hot, Stella replied. 'I can't work and I've got a headache! 'Message received. So everything's normal,' I said. 'That's what I like to hear. What are you reading about?'\\n'Air-conditioning units. You know what they are - smart machines that cool down rooms.' She held a picture\\nof one up.\\n'Dream on! These things cost money,' I said. The phone rang. It was Joe.\\n'Nat? I've been watching Wiseman Cabs all afternoon. There's a lot of movement in and out of that office. Cab drivers going in carrying one suitcase then coming out with a different one, and driving away. Seem to be doing everything except carrying passengers?\\n'Interesting. I wonder what Wiseman's up to?' 'The answer's in those suitcases, boss! 'Did you get some photos?' I asked.\\n\\n\\n'Used a whole roll of film. It's being developed now,' Joe replied. 'Well done. There'll be a cold beer with your name on it waiting at McFadden's:\\nWhy pay for a sauna when all you have to do is sit and sweat in your office? Maybe Stella was right. She was usually right about a lot of things. I was just thinking about the cold beers when Dr. Fischer phoned from Bellevue Hospital. Annie's condition was getting much worse.\\n'How much longer has she got, Doctor?' I asked.\\n'She's had heart trouble for years, and then with that heart attack at the station I'm seriously worried, Mr. Marley!\\n'Is she still conscious?' 'Yes, but only just!\\n'Well, I've got something that should make her hold on,' I said. 'We're looking for her son and getting closer. We've found his old boss in the East Village. There seems to have been some argument between them. My guess is Jackie's keeping away from him. Just tell her we're getting close.'\\nI felt both sad and angry as I put down the phone. Sad for the people who had to live out their lives on the\\nstreets.\\nAngry about the society that put them on the streets.\\n\\n\\nStella stopped reading and looked up. 'What's the matter, Nat?' 'It's Annie. If we don't find Jackie soon, she's going to die without seeing him,' I said. 'Nat, I got an idea.\\n'Yeah?'\\n'Why don't I phone every cab company in the book? I could say I'm Jackie's ex-girlfriend wanting to see him again, to talk things over,' Stella said.\\n'Good thinking. But first, I need some food and beer. I'll see you in McFadden's after you've locked up.\\nEd Winchester from the Daily News was watching me as I finished my first beer. It was cool and delicious and hardly touched the sides of my throat as it went down. I immediately felt better.\\n'Nat, what a thirst! Now have I got something for you from the Daily News five years ago. But first ... 'I get it. The story's going to cost me another drink. This had better be good!\\nEd handed me a photocopy of a news story. The headline read 'Weissmann and Clayton Not Guilty! I continued reading. 'Ernst Weissmann and Jackie Clayton walked free today after being found not guilty of buying and selling stolen property.\\n'That's it,' I said. 'Joe spent the afternoon watching what was going on at Wiseman Cabs. Jackie Clayton used\\n\\n\\nto work for Wiseman Cabs. In this story, Jackie was with a guy called Weissmann. Maybe he changed his name to make it sound more American.'\\nJoe had arrived with the photos. Picture after picture of cab drivers going in and out of the office with different suitcases. And a beautiful picture of Wiseman.\\n'That's him, I said. 'Now if we compare him with the picture of Ernst Weissmann in the Daily News story.\\nYeah, it's the same guy.

Inside there was a fat woman. She did not look like an 'Eloise'. 'Will you buy my hair?' Della asked.\\n'I buy hair, Madame replied. 'Take your hat off, then, and show me your hair? The beautiful brown hair fell down.\\n'Twenty dollars,' Madame said, and she touched the hair with her hand. 'Quick! Cut it off! Give me the money!' Della said. The next two hours went quickly.

She picked up her bag of drawing and painting things. “I\\'m going out to paint.”\\n\\n\\nSteve smiled at her. \"Don\\'t get too friendly with any ghosts!” He tried to put his arm round her, but she pushed him away.\\n“Didn\\'t I do that when I joined this family?\" she said.\\nElise woke up and there again was the same image, in the same place. It was exactly the same as yesterday morning.\\n“It\\'s the light,” she thought. Grey light came from between the bedroom curtains, like the light of an old black and white film. In it she could see boys and girls in coats. They were carrying packages, and some had baggy over their shoulders. And was that an army lorry?\\nShe watched for a minute. Then she got up to look out. The village square was empty except for a few cars. Some birds flew above the war memorial in the early morning sun.\\n“I can\\'t explain it scientifically,” she thought. “But I\\'m guessing that the village square gets mirrored in the room. It\\'s as simple as that. And the lorry? Well that\\'s the school bus\\' in this little village. But why didn\\'t I see the lorry drive away? Why didn\\'t I hear it?\"\\nShe stood at the window. The birds were on the war memorial now, and on the ground in front of it. Could the birds be the schoolchildren? Elise began to get dressed. “So that\\'s my excitement for the day,” she thought. “This is going to be my most\\n\\n\\nboring holiday ever!\"\\nShe looked across at the village church.\\n', \"Nelson Mandela was born into a divided country. The rulers of South Africa were white people whose ancestors came from Europe. They came to the country only a few hundred years earlier but the ancestors of the black majority had lived in South Africa for thousands of years.\\nThe Dutch were the first Europeans to live in South Africa.\\nThey arrived at the Cape of Good Hope in 1652. The Cape was a trading post. Dutch ships could stop there for fresh food and water. The people who lived in the area were called Hottentots and Bushmen. The Dutch wanted the Hottentots to work for them, but the Hottentots refused. So the Dutch brought prisoners and slaves from Asia to work for them.\\nSoon more white people came. They wanted to live in the country and become farmers, or Boers, as they are called in Dutch. At first the Africans shared the land. But more white people came and they wanted more and more land. When the Europeans took land they expected to keep it forever. The Boers sometimes caught Africans to make them slaves. The Africans fought the Boers, but they could not win against European weapons.\\nIn the early 1800s, the British took over the Cape from the Dutch. The British liked the warm weather and the good land for farming. Soon they were coming in large numbers. The Boers were not happy about this. The British had a different language and different ideas. The British made slavery illegal and gave equal rights to non-whites. This made the Boers angry. In 1836, thousands of Boers gathered their slaves, cattle and sheep and moved north.\\n\\n\\nThey wanted to escape the British. During the journey, the Boers fought many battles with the African tribes. The Xhosa, Sotho and Zulu all tried to stop them, but they only had spears and clubs. The Boers had guns. In one fight, three thousand Zulus were killed near a river. Today that river is called Blood River.\\nThe Boers moved north of the British and founded two independent countries, Transvaal and the Orange Free\\nState.\\nThe Boers did not think of themselves as Dutch anymore. They were ‘Afrikaners,' they said, 'the white tribe of Africa'.\\nIn the beginning, the British were not interested in the Afrikaners. That changed when diamonds and gold were found in the late 1800s. Between 1880 and 1902, the British and Boers fought two wars. But Britain had more weapons and its army was more powerful. In 1910, the Union of South Africa became one country and a part of the British Empire. Before the war, the British promised that all black Africans would be able to vote. However, the new British leaders only gave votes to blacks living in the Cape. And most of these blacks could not take part in elections. Only white people could do that. So blacks in the Cape could vote - but only for white people. And many blacks in the rest of South Africa could not vote at all.\", \"Some years ago, on a wet and miserable November day, I decided to get on a ship and sail to different parts of the world.\\nThere was nothing to interest me on shore and I was feeling irritable and bad-tempered. Whenever I feel like\\nthis, I know that it is time for me to go to sea again. Not as a passenger though.\\nFor that you need money, and I never have enough. Nor as a ship's captain, for I do not want to be responsible for other men.\\nIt is as much as I can do to be responsible for myself. When I go to sea, I go as an ordinary sailor.\\nSo I packed my old bag and left Manhattan to go to New Bedford, where I would get a boat to the island of Nantucket.\\nWhy Nantucket? Because this time I was going to look for work on a whaling ship! It was my dream to hunt and catch a whale, that magnificent and mysterious creature of the sea. And all the biggest and best whaling ships sailed out of Nantucket Island, off the coast of Massachusetts.\\nI arrived in New Bedford on a Saturday night in December. I went straight to the docks but was disappointed to discover that the little boat for Nantucket had already sailed. There would not be another boat to the island until Monday. I had very little money with me, for I had hoped to find a ship quickly. Now I had to find somewhere to eat\\n\\n\\nand sleep, so I began to walk through the streets. Snow covered the ground and the ice-cold wind blew into my face. I passed several inns but they looked too expensive, so I went back down to the docks again.\\nHere, in these dark and nearly empty streets, were the cheapest places to get a bed for the night. After a time, a sign appeared over my head in the darkness. It hung outside an old wooden building.\\nThe place looked suitable, so I pushed open the door and went inside. I stepped into a long, badly lit room with blackened walls.\\nThere were harpoons and spears fixed to the walls, and a large painting of a whale and whaling ships. I found Peter Coffin, the landlord, and explained that I needed a room for two nights.\\n'Every room and every bed is occupied, Coffin told me. “But you could share a bed with a harpooner. Are you going whaling?'\\n'Yes, I am, I answered. 'Then you'd better get used to sharing a bed,' he said. 'All right,' I replied. I was tired, and it was too cold and dark to walk the streets in a strange town to look for\\nanother place to stay.\\nSoon after, the landlord brought me a supper of meat and potatoes and boiling hot tea. It was very good. 'Where's the harpooner who will share my bed?' I asked him when I had finished eating.\", '\"Let\\'s put it here,” Mr. Walsh says to his son, Ryan. Mr. Walsh has an old boat. He does not want it now. They are putting his old boat on the beach. Ryan says, “But, Dad, we can\\'t put the boat here!\" Mr. Walsh says, “Ryan, it\\'s okay. Nobody is looking.”\\nRyan helps his father. They put the old boat on the beach. Ryan sees a man. The man is walking his dog on the beach. “Dad,” he says, “Somebody is coming. Come on! Let\\'s go!\" Ryan\\'s father says, “Okay. Let\\'s go.”\\nThe next morning, some people come to the beach. One of the boys sees the old boat. His name is Tyler. “Look at that!” says Tyler. “That\\'s a nice boat!” he says. Tyler\\'s friend David says, “No, it\\'s not. It\\'s broken. It\\'s no good.” Their friend Faye is looking at the boat, too.\\n\\n\\nTyler says, “But we can fix it, and then we can have it!\" David says, “But it\\'s not ours.\" \"I know. It\\'s not ours,\" says Tyler. \"... but nobody wants it. We can fix it, and then it can be our boat.\" “Tyler, that\\'s a great idea,” says Faye.\\nThen, two men come to the beach. They look at the boat.\\n\"What are you doing?” David asks one man. \"We\\'re taking the boat away,” says the man. David asks, “Whose boat is it?\" “I don\\'t know,\" says the man. “It\\'s a good boat, but nobody wants it.”\\n“Can we have it?\" asks Tyler. “We can fix the boat,\" he says. “That\\'s a great idea,” says the man. Tyler asks, “So, can we have it, please?\" The man says, “Yes, I think it\\'s okay.\" \"Great! Thanks,\" Tyler says. He\\'s very happy.\\n\\n\\n“Let\\'s come back and get it on Saturday,\" says Faye. David says, “My father has a truck. He doesn\\'t work on Saturday. He can help us.” “But the boat has no engine,” says David. “And we don\\'t have any money.\" “I know!\" says Faye. “But we can work and get some money. Then we can buy things for the boat.” \"Good thinking!\" says David.\\nThe next day they work to get some money. Faye sells some hot dogs at the beach. Tyler plays music in the town. And David cleans windows. They get a lot of\\nmoney.\\nThey can buy many things for the boat.\\nOn Saturday, they take the boat to David\\'s house. David\\'s father, Mr. Robinson helps them. He gives them an engine for the boat. Tyler and Mr. Robinson fix the boat. Faye and David paint it. It is looking good now. But Ryan is watching them.\\n', \"The children and their father remember Miranda, of course, and they talk about her sometimes.\\nMiranda's sister often visits us, and she always tells the children a story about their mother. Nick remembers\\nMiranda; I know he does. And in the hospital, Grandma remembers, too. They all remember Miranda.\\nI never met Miranda, but every day I look at her photograph, next to the telephone in the kitchen, the picture of her with her children. Every day I look at her beautiful dark eyes and her long dark hair.\\nI first saw Miranda's photograph two years ago. It was a cold October day, and I left London for my new job with a family in Norfolk. I drove north, past Norwich, and it began to rain. It was dark and there was a strong wind so I drove slowly and carefully. I wanted to see the Harvey children before they went to bed. But because of the weather, it was eight o'clock before I arrived in Cromer. I drove through the town, along the sea road.\\nSuddenly, I stopped. There was a tree across the road. I got out of my car. It was a big tree, and I couldn't move it. Just then, a car drove up behind me and a man got out.\\n'What's the matter? Oh a tree across the road. He was a tall man, about thirty years old. 'Where are you going?' he asked. 'Not far,' I said. It's a house along this road, near the sea. It's called Beach House.\\n'Oh, I know Beach House,' the man said. “It's the last house along this road. But you can't drive there tonight, with this tree across the road. He stopped for a minute.\\n\\nI'm Nick Watson, and I live at the farm along the road. We can go back to my house, and then walk across the fields to Beach House. Are you visiting for the weekend?'\\n'No, no. I'm going to work in the house and look after Mr Harvey's children. Their mother died two years ago,\\nand their grandmother has arthritis in her legs and can't walk much now. So I'm going to look after the children and the house,' I told him. 'I met old Mrs Harvey in London, six weeks ago, and she gave me the job. Do you know the Harveys?'\\nThe man laughed. His laugh was warm and friendly. 'Oh, yes, I know them,' he said.\\nWe drove back down the road and into the farm. Then we walked across the fields. It was dark and windy and cold. After ten minutes we arrived at a big white house. The lights were on downstairs, and the house looked friendly. I had no home because my mother and father died a long time ago, and I had no brothers or sisters. This was my first job and I wanted to be happy in this house.\\nA man opened the door. He looked tired and there was no smile on his face. 'Hello, I'm Cathy Wilson,' I began. I'm very late, I know. It's because the weather's so bad!\\n\", \"'Run,' the man thought. “Move! Faster! I can't stop now.' Over the man's head the night sky was black and cold, and in front of him were the trees. Tall, dark trees ... five hundred metres away.\\n'I can hide there, the man thought. 'I can hide in those trees. They can't see me in the trees. He looked behind him. He could see the lights. There were five or six men. They ran fast, and their lights moved up and down. They were not far away now. He could hear their feet on the ground.\\nThe man ran faster. His legs were tired, his body was tired. There were noises in his head, he could not see. The trees were two hundred metres away. He wanted to stop running. He wanted to lie down and sleep.\\nThen he heard a new noise. Dogs.\\n'They've got dogs!' he thought. 'Oh no! Not dogs! I can't run faster' But he did. Faster and faster. The trees were a hundred metres away ... fifty ... twenty ...\\nAnd then he was there. The trees opened their dark arms to him. But he did not stop running. It was dark and quiet under the trees. He ran first to the left, and then to the right. He came to a hill, and for a second or two he stopped and listened.\\nNothing. Then he heard the dogs again, but he could not see the lights.\\n'Don't stop now,' he thought. 'Dogs don't need eyes. They can find you in the dark.' Quickly he ran down the hill. It was very dark here, and he could not see very well. He ran into a tree and nearly broke his arm.\\n\\n\\n'Careful!' he thought. Careful. He put his hands out in front of him, and ran more slowly. Then he heard a\\nnew noise.\\nWater.\\n'A river!' he thought. 'The dogs can't follow me across water. Where is it? Quick!' Soon he found the river. It\\nwas not very big, but it ran quickly.\\nThe water was cold on his tired legs. He walked and ran up the river, through the water, for about two kilometres. Then he stopped and listened again.\\nHe could hear nothing. He stood there and waited. The trees watched him with dark, secret eyes.\\nNothing. No dogs, no lights, no noises. The man was cold now, and very, very tired. 'I need sleep, he thought. 'Where can I hide?' He looked up at\\nthe trees.\\nUp there,' he thought. 'The dogs can't follow me up a tree! He found a tall tree and went up it. He could not see the ground now. He half sat, half stood in the tree, and listened.\\nNothing.\\n'An hour,' he thought. 'Sleep for an hour. Then go on. Go south. Hide in the day, and move at night. I can get there in five days, perhaps six! The man put his head down on his arms, and slept.\", \"Mr Sniggs, the Assistant Dean, and Mr Postlethwaite, the Domestic Bursar, sat alone in Mr Sniggs' room in Scone College. They were the only dons who were at home that evening. Their colleagues were at parties in Oxford, or visiting friends, or attending meetings at other colleges, because it was the night of the annual Bollinger Club dinner-always a difficult time for those responsible for university discipline.\\nIn fact, it is not accurate to call this an annual event, because quite often so much trouble is caused that the\\nClub does not meet again for some years. There is tradition behind the Bollinger; it takes its name from the famous champagne, and past members include men who are now heads of royal families. The last dinner was three years ago. What a wild, destructive night that had been! This was the first meeting since then, and old members had poured into Oxford from all over Europe especially for the occasion-foreign royalty, country gentlemen, Scottish landowners, smooth young businessmen, ambitious lawyers and politicians- to join those who were currently students at this great university.\\nThe party had already started. Mr Postlethwaite and Mr Sniggs could hear the sound of confused shouting and breaking of glass from Sir Alastair Digby-Vane-Trumpington's rooms. They listened eagerly, looking out of the window into the courtyard.\\n'The fines!' said Mr Sniggs, as he lit his pipe. 'Oh, yes! The fines they'll have to pay after this evening!' There is some excellent port that is only served to\\n\\n\\ndons when College fines have reached £50.\\n'We shall have a week of it, at least,' said Mr Postlethwaite. 'A week of College port!' Louder noises were now coming from Sir Alastair's rooms-a frightening sound for those who have heard it before, the hunting cry of the ancient English families. Soon they would all be rushing into the courtyard, red-faced and shouting, ready for the real fun of the evening.\\n'Don't you think it might be wiser if we turned off the light?' said Mr Sniggs. In darkness the two men crept to the window. The courtyard below was already a sea of scarcely recognizable\\nfaces.\\n'There must be fifty of them at least!' said Mr Postlethwaite. 'If only they were all members of the College! Fifty of them at ten pounds each!\\n'Oh!' It'll be more if they attack the Chapel, said Mr Sniggs. 'Oh, please God, make them attack the Chapel! 'I wonder who the unpopular students are this year. The Bollinger always attack their rooms. I hope they've been wise enough to go out for the evening!\\n'There's Austen - he has a beautiful piano, I'm told. And Partridge will be another one. I think he collects French paintings!\\n\\n\\n'Lord Rending can afford to hunt, but he collects teapots instead. And Sanders has won prizes for his poems, you know.'\\n'There'll be a heavy bill for tonight, just you see! But I must say I'd feel happier if some of our colleagues were here. The Bollinger can't see us from here, can they?'\\nIt was a lovely evening. They smashed Austen's piano, destroyed Partridge's French paintings, broke Sanders' windows and Rending's teapots. Sir Alastair felt quite ill with excitement, and had to be helped to his bed. It was half-past eleven. Soon the evening would come to an end. But there was still something to look forward to.\\n\", 'Meg stood with her hands in her pockets, looking out of the studio window. The heater wasn\\'t working and she had a blanket over her shoulders to keep out the cold. The wind was coming up from the lake and blowing around\\nthe outside of the studio. She watched her husband, Ben, as he played in the garden with Jack, their two year\\nold son. Father and son both wore ski-jackets to keep out the cold. Jack laughed as Ben lifted him high into the air. Their brown and white dog ran over and jumped up, wanting to play.\\nMeg wanted to go out and join in the game. Instead she glanced over her shoulder at her unfinished painting. It was in the center of the studio, waiting for her. She knew she should get back to work, but still she stayed by the window. Her husband waved and carried their son in the direction of the lake. Meg smiled at her son\\'s shouts of delight; he loved the water.\\nWith a sigh, Meg turned and walked back to the painting. It was nearly finished, she knew, but she wasn\\'t satisfied. The picture showed the covered bridge that Meg could see from her studio window. She looked out of the window at the river as it reflected the cold morning sky. Then she studied the painting again. It needed more white, she thought. Picking up her paintbrush, she started to paint.\\nThe wooden bridges were famous in New Hampshire. Tourists came from all over the world to see them. Meg first got interested in them eight months earlier, when she and Ben moved to the area from New York. Now most of\\n\\n\\nher paintings were of the bridges in different seasons and different lights.\\nBy the time she finished painting, it was almost one o\\'clock. She stood back and studied the picture, it wasn\\'t perfect but it was certainly better. She washed the paint from her hands and was drying them when the telephone\\nrang. Putting down the towel, she answered it.\\n\"Meg, I\\'ve got some great news,” announced the voice on the other end of the line.\\n\"Hi Gloria, what\\'s got you so excited?\" Meg asked, smiling at the sound of her friend\\'s voice. Gloria was a cheerful forty-five year old who owned a gallery in town where Meg sold her paintings.\\n\"You know Avant Garde Magazine?\" \"Avant Garde? Isn\\'t that an art magazine?\"\\n\"Not an art magazine, Meg, it\\'s the art magazine - one of the most important in New York.” Gloria didn\\'t wait for Meg to reply before continuing breathlessly, “And they want to interview you.\"\\n\"Me?\" Meg\\'s eyes were wide, “There must be some mistake.” \"No, there\\'s no mistake. They called me a minute ago.”\\n\"But why do they want to interview me?\" Meg sat down on an old chair next to the window and brushed her dark hair back from her face.']\n"
