My name is Jonathan Harker. I am a lawyer and I live in London. About seven years ago, some strange and terrible things happened to me. Many of my dear friends were in danger too. At last we have decided to tell the story of that terrible time. Part of my work is to find houses in England for rich people who live in foreign countries. At the beginning of 1875, I received a letter from Transylvania, a country in Eastern Europe. The letter was from a rich man called Count Dracula. He wanted to buy a house near London. The Count asked me to find him an old house with a large garden. The price of the house was not important. I found him a large, old house to the east of London. I wrote to the Count and he agreed to buy it. There were many papers which he had to sign. To my surprise, Count Dracula invited me to visit him in his castle in Transylvania. ‘Bring the papers with you,’ he wrote in his letter. ‘I can sign them here.’ I was very busy and did not want to go. Transylvania was faraway and few English people had been there. There was another reason too. I was going to get married in the autumn to my darling Mina. I did not want to leave England until we were married. But Mina said that I should go. ‘The Count is a rich man,’ she said. ‘You may be able to do more business with him. You can travel most of the way by train. In two weeks, you will be home again. ’So I accepted Count Dracula’s invitation. I left England at the end of April. Mina gave me a book about Transylvania to read on the train.
